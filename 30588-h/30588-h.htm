<h1><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>THE PONY RIDER BOYS IN ALASKA</h1>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>THROUGH ENCHANTING WATERS</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Captain, who are the four silent men leaning over the rail on the
other side of the boat?&#8221; asked Tad Butler. &#8220;I have been wondering
about them almost ever since we left Vancouver. They don&#8217;t seem to speak
to a person, and seldom to each other, though somehow they appear to be
traveling in company. They act as if they were afraid someone would recognize
them. I am sure they aren&#8217;t bad characters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Petersen, commander of the steamer &#8220;Corsair,&#8221; which for
some days had been plowing its way through the ever-changing northern waters,
stroked his grizzled beard reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad characters, eh?&#8221; he twinkled. &#8220;Well, no, I
shouldn&#8217;t say as they were. They&#8217;re fair-weather <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>lads. I&#8217;ll vouch for
them if necessary, and I guess I&#8217;m about the only person on board that
knows who they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad waited expectantly until the skipper came to the point of the story he
was telling.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are the Gold Diggers of Taku Pass, lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Gold Diggers of Taku Pass?&#8221; repeated Tad Butler. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think I ever heard that name before. Where is this pass,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>The skipper shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one knows,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is strange,&#8221; wondered Butler. &#8220;Does no one know where
they dig for gold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. They don&#8217;t even know themselves,&#8221; was the puzzling
reply.</p>

<p>Tad fixed the weather-beaten face of the skipper with a questioning gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I understand, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I know about it some other time, lad. I
haven&#8217;t the time to spin the yarn now. It&#8217;s a long one. I&#8217;ve
been sailing up and down these waters, fair weather and foul, for a good many
years, and I&#8217;ve seen a fair cargo of strange things in my time, but this
Digger outfit is the most peculiar one I ever came across. They are a living
example of what the lure of gold means when it gets into a man&#8217;s system.
Gold is all right. I <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_13'></a>13</span>wish I had more of it; but, my boy, don&#8217;t ever
let the love of it get to the windward of you if you hope to enjoy peace of mind
afterwards,&#8221; concluded the skipper with emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that he says about gold?&#8221; interjected Stacy Brown,
more commonly known to his companions as Chunky, the fat boy.</p>

<p>Stacy, with Ned Rector and Walter Perkins, had been lounging against the
starboard rail of the &#8220;Corsair,&#8221; observing Tad and the Captain as
they talked. A few paces forward sat Professor Zepplin, their traveling
companion, wholly absorbed in a scientific discussion with an engineer who was
on his way to an Alaskan mine, of which the latter was to assume control. Many
other passengers were strolling about the decks of the &#8220;Corsair.&#8221;
There were seasoned miners with bearded faces; sharp-eyed, sharp-featured men
with shifty eyes; pale-faced prospectors on their way to the land of promise, in
quest of the yellow metal; capitalists going to Alaska to look into this or that
claim with a view to investment; and, more in evidence than all the rest, a
large list of tourists bound up the coast on a merry holiday. The former, in
most instances, were quiet, reserved men, the latter talkative and
boisterous.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Captain was speaking of the lure that gold holds for the human
race,&#8221; replied Tad <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_14'></a>14</span>Butler in answer to Stacy Brown&#8217;s question.
&#8220;I guess the Captain is right, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be warned in time, Chunky,&#8221; added Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen enough gold to become lured by it,&#8221;
retorted the fat boy. &#8220;I should like to see enough to excite me just once.
I shouldn&#8217;t mind being lured that way. Would you, Walt?&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter Perkins shook his head and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear you will have to shake yourself&#8211;get over your natural
laziness&#8211;before you can hope to,&#8221; chuckled Ned. &#8220;I doubt if
you would know a lure if you met one on Main Street in Chillicothe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try me and see,&#8221; grinned Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be a lot of gold up here, judging from what I have read,
and from the number of persons going after it,&#8221; added Tad, with a sweeping
gesture that included the deckload of miners and prospectors. &#8220;But the
hardships and the heart-breakings must be terrible. I have read a lot about the
terrors that men have gone through in this country, especially in the awful
winters they have in Alaska.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t mind them if I had a sledge and a pack of dogs to
tote me around, the way they do up here,&#8221; declared Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be great fun,&#8221; agreed young <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>Perkins. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have
far to fall if you got bucked off from that kind of broncho, would you,
Stacy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not unless you fell off a mountain,&#8221; answered Ned, glancing at
the distant towering cliffs of the coast range.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was asking the Captain about those four men yonder,&#8221; said
Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the fellows who don&#8217;t speak to anyone?&#8221; nodded
Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are they? I have wondered about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know their names, but the skipper tells me they are
known as the Gold Diggers of Taku Pass,&#8221; replied Butler. &#8220;The queer
part of it is, he says, that no one, so far as he is aware, knows even that
there is such a place as Taku Pass. They don&#8217;t know themselves,&#8221;
added Tad with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s strange,&#8221; wondered Rector. &#8220;Crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I think not. They are prospecting for an unknown claim,&#8221;
replied Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I don&#8217;t know anything about that,&#8221; spoke up Stacy
Brown. &#8220;But I know who those fellows are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do?&#8221; exclaimed the boys in chorus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I asked them. That&#8217;s the way to <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>find out what you want to know,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; chuckled Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are they?&#8221; asked Butler laughingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The minery-looking fellow is Sam Dawson. The one beside him is Curtis
Darwood. The tall, slim chap nearest to us is Dill Bruce. They call him the
Pickle for short.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks sour enough to be one,&#8221; laughed Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other chap, the little one, is Curley Tinker. And there you have
the whole outfit. I&#8217;ll introduce you to them if you like,&#8221;
volunteered Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you. I already have tried to talk with the men, but they
don&#8217;t seem inclined to open their mouths,&#8221; replied Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;It strikes me that you have made more progress that anyone else on
this boat, so far as the four gold diggers are concerned,&#8221; added Rector,
addressing Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am convinced that Chunky is rather forward,&#8221; agreed
Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no one can resist me,&#8221; averred the fat boy. &#8220;Anything
else you want to know, Tad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a great deal. But here is the Captain. He will tell
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Petersen had taken a fancy to the boys almost from the first. He had
learned who they were early on that voyage, and in the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>meantime they had become very well
acquainted with the commander of the &#8220;Corsair.&#8221; He had taken pains
to explain to the lads many things about the country past which they were
sailing&#8211;things that otherwise they would not have known, and the voyage
was proving very interesting to them, as well as to Professor Zepplin
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come below now and I&#8217;ll tell you the story,&#8221; invited
Captain Petersen, starting to descend the after companionway. &#8220;All of you
come along. That will save your asking questions later on,&#8221; he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, he invited you on my account,&#8221; chuckled Stacy Brown,
tapping his breast with the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>The lads filed down the companionway behind the Captain, and when they had
finally settled themselves in the skipper&#8217;s cabin and he had lighted his
pipe, he began to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always come below and put my feet on the table after we pass the
Shoal of Seals,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;That is the time I take my &#8216;watch
below,&#8217; as we call it, when we come down for a rest or a sleep. But you
are eager to hear the story. Very good. Here goes. A good many years ago an
expedition came up to this part of the world on an exploring mission. In that
party was a Dr. Darwood from some place in <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_18'></a>18</span>the East. I don&#8217;t believe I ever heard the name
of the place, and if I knew the state I have forgotten it. Well, to make a long
story short, the party was ambushed by the Kak-wan-tan Indians. Every man of the
party was captured and all were put to death, with the exception of Dr. Darwood.
Somehow, the Indians had learned that he was a big medicine man, so they made
the Doctor captive and took him over the mountains many miles from there. They
probably killed the others so as to make sure of the Doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they want with a medicine man?&#8221; interjected the fat
boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;They wanted him professionally. Their chief was a very sick man. I
guess the old gentleman was about ready to die. At least he thought so. The
chief bore the name of Chief Anna-Hoots. Nice name, eh? No wonder he got
sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have belonged to the owl family,&#8221; observed Chunky.</p>

<p>Tad rebuked the fat boy with a look. The Captain regarded Stacy quizzically,
then proceeded with his story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Their own medicine man had been killed by a bear. You see his medicine
wasn&#8217;t calculated to head off bears. The chief, therefore, was in a bad
way. Dr. Darwood was commanded <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_19'></a>19</span>to make the chief well, and, so the story goes, after
examining Hoots, he at once saw what was the trouble with the old man. He set to
work over the savage, not so much from a professional interest as that he knew
very well his life would be forfeited did he not do something for the patient.
It is a safe guess that the Doctor never had worked more heroically over a
patient. Well, he saved the chief&#8211;had him on his feet and hopping around
as lively as a jack-rabbit in less than twenty-four hours. There was great
rejoicing among Anna&#8217;s people, and Darwood was feasted and made much of.
He was almost as big a man as Old Hoots himself. Nothing was too good for him in
that camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he poison the whole tribe while he had the
chance?&#8221; questioned Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it wasn&#8217;t professional,&#8221; smiled the Captain in
reply. &#8220;But Chief Anna-Hoots&#8211;precious old rascal that he
was&#8211;was so grateful that he made the Doctor chief medicine man over all
the tribes and a tribal chief of one of the subordinate tribes. And now we are
coming to the point of our story. Old Hoots, later on, let the Doctor into a
great secret. Having driven the evil spirits out of Anna and set him on his feet
almost as good as new, the patient evidently was of the opinion that the
medicine <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>man was
entitled to something more than the ordinary fee for such a service. He took the
Doctor to a place where a roaring glacial stream of icy water was tearing down
through a narrow gash in the mountains on its way to the sea, and there he
showed the doctor-chief gold in great quantities, so the story runs, the pass
being guarded by the Bear Totem. It is not certain whether the vein from which
this gold had been washed was then known. I think Darwood must have found it
later on and located a claim. He at least took from the mouth of the pass enough
gold to make him a fairly rich man. This he hid away, awaiting a favorable
opportunity to get away with it. Such opportunity presented itself while his
tribe was away on a hunt in the fall for meat for the winter, and made his
escape. After some months of terrible hardships he succeeded in reaching
civilization, fairly staggering under the weight of the gold he had brought
away. He had the gold-madness badly, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was plucky,&#8221; muttered Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It was Darwood&#8217;s intention to return, at the head of a
well-armed party, properly equipped, and work the pay dirt to its limit. But he
died before he could do so. The hardships of that journey, loaded down with dust
and nuggets, led to his ultimate death. You <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_21'></a>21</span>see what avarice will do to a fellow. It gets to
windward of him every time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be willing to stagger under all I could carry and take my
chances on the future,&#8221; observed Chunky reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;So would we all,&#8221; nodded the skipper. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
worst of us, our greed. I am glad I am at sea, where I <i>can&#8217;t</i> dig.
Nothing was done in the matter of locating and working the claim for some years
after the Doctor&#8217;s death. Then a grandson, Curtis Darwood, who is now
aboard this boat, found a paper or map or something of the sort, on which was a
description of the Doctor&#8217;s find. It couldn&#8217;t have been very
definite or they wouldn&#8217;t have been so long in locating the place. Of
course, the younger man was fired with the desire to find this wonderful mine.
The lure had him fast and hard. He came up here alone the first time and
prospected all summer, but failed, and late that fall he went back home. When he
returned the three other men, who are his companions now, were with him. They
have been together ever since in their prospecting work. Dawson is a pioneer
prospector who knows the game thoroughly. The others, who have been up here
three years, might now be placed in the same class, though Dawson is the real
miner. One can&#8217;t help but admire their pluck and persistence, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span> but I shouldn&#8217;t want
to be caught interfering with them. When a fellow gets the gold madness he is a
dangerous customer to annoy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have they found the gold?&#8221; asked Walter Perkins.</p>

<p>Captain Petersen shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not. If they have, only they know it. They take no one into
their confidence. They went home for the winter last fall, and what amazes me
further is that they are getting up here so late this spring. Here it is June.
They should have been on the job six weeks ago, and in order to do so they ought
to have wintered in the hills. To me that means something. It will be a wonder
if this unusual move on their part doesn&#8217;t attract attention. You may
believe they are watched. There are, no doubt, those who are watching the
Diggers, and who do not miss any of their movements.&#8221; The skipper
hesitated, then brought a big fist down on his cabin table with a bang that set
the glassware jingling. &#8220;By George, I begin to see a light!&#8221; he
roared.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; cried Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, sir?&#8221; chorused Tad and Ned in one voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;That accounts for Red Whiskers. That accounts for his presence
on&#8211;&#8221; The skipper checked himself suddenly. &#8220;But no matter.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>It isn&#8217;t for me
to say.&#8221; He lapsed into thoughtful silence. &#8220;Well, what do you think
of the story?&#8221; he asked a few moments later.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all very remarkable,&#8221; answered Butler. &#8220;Where are
they going&#8211;their destination, I mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never can tell. They have explored pretty much all of the country
within a few hundred miles of here, and it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me at all if
they had stumbled over the right place dozens of times and didn&#8217;t know it.
But there is one significant fact. They have brought up a lot of equipment this
time. It looks as if they thought they had the place pretty well located. It
certainly does look that way. There&#8217;s another thing I forgot to tell you.
This place, this pass where the gold is supposed to lie, is the abode of a great
and angry spirit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A really, truly spirit?&#8221; questioned Walter wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say about the really-truly business,&#8221; replied
Captain Petersen, with a grin. &#8220;I am telling you the story as I have heard
it. Had Old Hoots&#8217; tribe known that the Doctor went in there and dug out
gold which he salted away they would have put him to death. It&#8217;s a sacred
place. It was then, and I&#8217;ll wager it is now. You may believe that the
superstition has been handed down.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>&#8220;But the
Indians up here now are not at all savage, are they?&#8221; asked Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not where the white man has taken possession in force. But you
get into the far interior&#8211;there is a great deal of Alaska that the white
man knows very little about yet&#8211;and you will find them savage enough,
provided they think they have you in a pocket, and especially so if you
interfere with any of their religious customs or beliefs. In these respects they
are simply human.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should call them inhuman,&#8221; observed the fat boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame them,&#8221; nodded Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that is the story of the Gold Diggers, so far as I know
it,&#8221; continued the Captain. &#8220;As I have already said, not many
persons up here do know it. A veil of mystery surrounds the four silent men.
They make no other friends, confide in no one, and live in a little world all
their own. The story, as I have repeated it to you, was told to me by a man from
their part of the country who came up here to spend the summer last season. That
is how I came to know the details. It is possible, though not probable, that you
might get them to tell you something about the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make them talk,&#8221; answered Stacy pompously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>&#8220;What is
their destination?&#8221; asked Butler quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Skagway. However, that undoubtedly is a blind. They may be going on
farther from that point, or they may be intending to work back along the coast
after they leave the ship, then strike into the hills at some remote point. I
can&#8217;t say as to that, of course. They will disappear. You may depend upon
that, and nothing may be heard of them again for a year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do they do for provisions?&#8221; questioned Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same as you will have to do if you penetrate far into the
interior. They hunt and fish, saving their canned supplies for the winter, for
the winter months are long and drear up in this far northern country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When does winter set in?&#8221; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very early. It seems to be most always winter up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you very much,&#8221; said Tad. &#8220;This has been most
interesting. I should like to ask them something about the country where we are
going. Of course I shouldn&#8217;t presume to question them about their own
affairs. That would be none of my business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had planned to strike north from Yakutat.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>&#8220;You will
find rough country that way. I should say you would have tough traveling all the
way. If you can get the Gold Diggers to open up, they will undoubtedly be able
to give you some useful information that would enable you to lay your course to
the best advantage. But I think I know the Diggers. You may not be able to get a
civil word out of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll talk to me,&#8221; answered the fat boy confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t permit yourself to be overcome,&#8221; warned
Rector. &#8220;Remember your most excellent opinion of yourself has been the
cause of some mighty falls already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I fell in soft spots anyhow,&#8221; retorted Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ordinarily on your head, I believe,&#8221; answered Ned quickly.</p>

<p>Again thanking the Captain for his kindness, the lads returned to the deck.
Tad leaned against the rail thinking over the story related by the skipper. The
romance of the quest of the Diggers appealed to Butler&#8217;s adventure-loving
nature. He declared to himself that he would draw them into conversation and
satisfy his further curiosity. Looking them over in the light of what he had
heard, Tad saw that the four were determined-looking men, were men who would do
and dare, no matter how great <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_27'></a>27</span>the obstacles or the perils. He could not but feel a
keen admiration for them. They were real men, even if they were surly and
reticent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tad, how would you like to belong to that party of prospectors?&#8221;
asked Ned, nodding toward the four.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine anything more exciting. I wish we might. I
wonder if they are going our way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you ask them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I intend to,&#8221; answered Tad, rousing himself and starting towards
the prospectors who were lounging apart from the other passengers on the deck of
the steamer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch him get turned down,&#8221; grinned Stacy. &#8220;I shall have
to break the ice for him. He never will be able to do it for himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better wait until you are asked,&#8221; advised Ned Rector.</p>

<p>As Stacy had said, Tad did not succeed in getting into conversation with the
Diggers that day. Early on the following morning the boys were on deck, being
unwilling to miss a single moment of the scenery.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Corsair&#8221; was swinging majestically into Queen Charlotte
Sound, a splendid sweep of purple water, where great waves from the Pacific
rolled in, sending the steamer plunging desperately. There was a scurry on the
part <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>of many of the
early risers to get below decks, for the change from the quiet waters through
which the boat had been sailing to this tumultuous sea was more than most of
them were able to stand. Stacy Brown was already on his back in the shadow of a
life boat, groaning miserably. Walter Perkins&#8217; face was pale, but he held
himself together by a strong effort of will, but Tad Butler and Ned Rector
appeared not in the least affected by the roll of the steamer. Both were lost in
admiration of the scene that was unfolding before them.</p>

<p>&#8220;They roll along with the lightness of thistledown across a green
field,&#8221; declared Tad enthusiastically, speaking to himself. &#8220;It is
simply glorious.&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard someone come to the rail at his side, but the lad was too fully
absorbed to look around.</p>

<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t bad for a sentiment, young fellow,&#8221; said a
voice at his elbow. &#8220;If you stay up in this country long enough, however,
you will get all the sentiment frozen out of you. I know, for I&#8217;ve been
all through it. I&#8217;m lucky that my bones aren&#8217;t up yonder
somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered Butler.</p>

<p>Glancing around he found himself gazing into the face of Curtis Darwood.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE BOYS SCENT A PLOT</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how do you do, sir. Did I say anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s a chance for a difference of opinion as to
that,&#8221; smiled the miner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been enjoying the scenery, sir. Isn&#8217;t it
beautiful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should see it at sunrise,&#8221; answered Darwood. &#8220;These
mists are well worth coming all the way up here to gaze upon. In the morning
they take on all the delicate tints of the primrose. Then at sunset of course
the colors grow warmer&#8211;amber, orange, gold&#8211;almost everything that
could be imagined in the way of wonderful colorings. All that sort of thing, you
know. I never saw anything like it in any part of the world, and I&#8217;ve seen
some,&#8221; added the Gold Digger reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to see it at sunset,&#8221; answered Tad. &#8220;Is it
ever like this in the interior, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Interior of what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of the country? Up there in the mountains?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>Darwood gave the
boy a quick glance of inquiry. There was suspicion in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the far country?&#8221; added Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say as to that; I can&#8217;t say that I know,&#8221;
replied the prospector shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What we wanted to ask you about was the Yakutat trail from the coast
up?&#8221; interjected Ned. &#8220;You see, we are going that way and we want to
get all the information we can about the trails and the country
itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad gave his companion a warning look, but Ned persisted in pressing his
questioning. The miner&#8217;s hands dropped from the rail.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you would better ask someone else. I can&#8217;t tell you
anything about the trail,&#8221; replied Darwood, turning on his heel and
striding away.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, you&#8217;ve done it now,&#8221; complained Butler ruefully.
&#8220;Of course you had to break in and spoil it all. Now we shan&#8217;t get
another opportunity. Mr. Darwood is suspicious of us, and he won&#8217;t talk
with us again. It&#8217;s too bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you wanted to know. What&#8217;s the use in beating about the
bush when you want to know a thing. I believe in asking for what you
want,&#8221; protested Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I, but it isn&#8217;t always best to go at it bald-headed.
However, never mind, Ned. I am now convinced that there would be little use
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>in asking Mr. Darwood
questions in any circumstances. The instant you begin to talk Alaska with that
man he is going to shy off. He fears he might be trapped into an admission, or
else he thinks we are trying to pump him for some other reason. You may be sure
that others have tried to draw him out, believing they might obtain information
that he is supposed to possess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are a queer lot,&#8221; muttered Ned. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t the
Captain say no one knew anything about this gold pass, or whatever you call
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Taku Pass? Yes. That is, he said few persons knew of it, but you may
be sure that the purpose of these men up here is known. There are plenty of
gentlemen waiting to beat those four into the land of golden promise. I
don&#8217;t blame the Diggers for having their suspicions of everyone about
them. I wish I could convince them that we aren&#8217;t that sort of people. I
like that fellow. I&#8217;d like to help him, too,&#8221; mused Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t. However, I&#8217;m sorry I put my foot in
it,&#8221; nodded Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be. See! We are running out of the swell
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The steamer, soon coming under the lee of the islands, was steaming into
Fitzhugh Sound, where dangerous shoals menace the navigators <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>of these enchanting waters.
Captain Petersen was now occupying the little bridge just forward of the pilot
house. His face was grim and set. The good fellow was no longer present&#8211;it
was now the master, bent upon attending to his duties.</p>

<p>The sound is a slender waterway, extending directly northward fully thirty
miles, more entrancing, it seemed to the boys, than any other water over which
they had sailed. The Pony Rider Boys were having a glorious passage into the far
north where they were going in search of new adventure. They were bound for the
wildest and most remote section of Uncle Sam&#8217;s domain, where they hoped to
spend the summer months.</p>

<p>Now that the waters had become more quiet, Stacy Brown slowly dragged himself
from the shadow of the life-boat and stood gripping the gunwale. After getting
his head leveled somewhat he walked unsteadily to his companions who were
leaning on the steamer&#8217;s rail regarding him with smiling faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sick?&#8221; questioned Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; merely ailing,&#8221; replied the fat boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be a landlubber,&#8221; jeered Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would, if you were in my place,&#8221; muttered Stacy.</p>

<p>On through a panorama of changing scenes <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_33'></a>33</span>and colors sailed the &#8220;Corsair.&#8221; In
Finlayson Channel, some distance farther on, the forest that lined the shores
was a solid mountain of green on each side, the trees growing down to the water.
Here the reflections were so brilliant that the dividing line between shore and
water was difficult for the untrained eye to make out. The boys seemed to be
gazing upon an optical illusion. From the water&#8217;s edge the mountains rose
sheer to a great height, their distant peaks capped with snow glistening in the
morning sunlight, while glacial streams flashed over the open spaces on the
mountain sides.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there no end to it?&#8221; wondered Tad Butler, gazing at the
scenery until his eyes ached.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all very wonderful,&#8221; agreed Professor Zepplin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I call it tiresome,&#8221; declared the fat boy wearily. &#8220;I
prefer something exciting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned suggested that he jump overboard. Stacy replied that he would were it not
that he didn&#8217;t want to put his companions to the trouble of rescuing
him.</p>

<p>The entrancing scenery continued at intervals until the evening of the second
day after their unsuccessful attempt to draw out Curtis Darwood. They were now
passing through Frederick Sound, bordered by spire-shaped <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>glaciers that towered in the sky, pale and
chaste, more than two thousand feet above the sound. Darkness fell, the sky
being overcast, and the air chill, giving the passengers the shivers and sending
them to their cabins below. Tad Butler and Ned Rector had clambered to the top
of the deck-house and settled themselves between the two smokestacks. It was a
nice warm berth and they appreciated it. They seemed far away from human
habitation there.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said you had something to tell me this evening,&#8221; Ned
reminded his companion, after a few moments of contented silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It was about last night. You remember that remark of the
skipper&#8217;s the other day, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What he said about &#8216;Red Whiskers&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the gentleman located, Ned. I am reasonably certain that I
have. Of course it&#8217;s none of my business, but I have been curious ever
since the Captain said that. My man has red whiskers, regular combustible
whiskers,&#8221; added the freckle-faced boy with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are several men on board this boat who wear red upholstery on
their chins,&#8221; averred Rector.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>&#8220;I know
that, but this one is the fellow, all right,&#8221; declared Tad in a confident
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know something!&#8221; exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. Don&#8217;t speak so loudly. Someone might hear. I heard someone
passing along the deck just below us a moment ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one down there could distinguish what we were saying,&#8221;
answered Ned, as the two drew back farther between the steel bases of the two
funnels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; urged Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man referred to by Captain Petersen is Sandy Ketcham, the tall,
lank fellow, with the squinty eyes and the stoop shoulders. He has a trick of
peering up from under his eyelids when he looks at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I know the one you mean, and I don&#8217;t like his looks. How did
you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since the Captain made that remark about &#8216;Red Whiskers&#8217; I have
been taking an interest in every man on the boat who wore red whiskers,&#8221;
said Tad. &#8220;I tried to decide, in my own mind, which of them was the right
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So did I,&#8221; admitted Ned. &#8220;But I got all mixed up. If you
succeeded in picking out the right one you are mighty sharp. I wish I were as
keen as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keen? Not a bit of it! It was a pure accident that I found out. I just
blundered on the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_36'></a>36</span>truth last night. The man I had picked out
wasn&#8217;t the fellow at all. I had the wrong man, so you see I am not so
smart as you thought. You remember you left Stacy and myself sitting on a bale
of freight at the rear end of the boat when you went down late last
evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Chunky was half asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. Well, I shook him up a few moments later and he went below
grumbling because I wouldn&#8217;t let him sleep when he was so comfortable. He
was liable to catch cold in the damp air. Then I went to sleep myself,&#8221;
admitted Butler. &#8220;I&#8217;m not much of an adviser, am I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; urged Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something awakened me. Two men were talking nearby. I couldn&#8217;t
see them, but could hear every word they said. One of the two I recognized by
his voice. The other I was unable to place. I got him placed right to-day
though, when I heard him talking on deck. They are a precious pair of rascals,
Ned. Perhaps it is considered fair enough up here to do those things, but I just
can&#8217;t hold myself when I see crookedness going on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t said what it was about yet,&#8221; reminded Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were plotting against Darwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>&#8220;Yes, they
were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to tell you now. The question is, ought I to tell Mr.
Darwood? Would it be right to carry tales, even in a case like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not knowing what the case is I can&#8217;t very well advise
you,&#8221; answered Ned Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not say a word about that until I have decided what
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a queer chap, Tad. You arouse my curiosity; then you
won&#8217;t satisfy it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall know all about it in good time. Hark! Was that you who
kicked the collar of the stack?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I didn&#8217;t hear anything. Who was the other man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His name is Ainsworth. He is a prospector, too. They are together, he
and the man Sandy. There are some others in the plot, as I learned from the
conversation, but I hardly think they are on board. I take it that the others
are to meet this party at Skagway, which proves to me that the plans of our
friends, the four Gold Diggers, were learned by the plotters some time before
the former set sail for the north country. Oh, it is a fine game of grab they
are planning! But I believe that, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_38'></a>38</span>if Mr. Darwood be warned in time, he will be perfectly
able to take care of himself. I am quite sure I shouldn&#8217;t care to be the
other fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why we should get so excited over it,&#8221;
grumbled Ned. &#8220;Darwood and his companions are no friends of ours. I should
say that quite the opposite is the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they are real men, just the same,&#8221; objected Tad. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t care whether they are friendly to us or not. Come on; let&#8217;s
get down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grasping awning spars the two lads swung down to the promenade of the upper
deck. After they had cleared the deck-house a man dropped to the deck from the
deck-house, on the opposite side.</p>

<p>After a few moments&#8217; stroll, during which the boys continued their
conversation, they went below. On reaching his cabin, Butler discovered that he
had lost his pocket knife. Thinking that it had slipped from his pocket while
the two were lounging on the deck-house, Tad went back to look for it. He was
the only person in sight on deck. That part of the deck was unlighted, save as a
faint glow shone up through the engine room grating. The freckle-faced boy
looked carefully about on top of the deck-house for several minutes, in search
of <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>his lost knife,
lighting match after match to aid him in his quest. He failed to find it. With a
grunt of disappointment he again swung himself to the deck.</p>

<p>The instant his feet touched the deck, Tad Butler met with a violent
surprise. He was suddenly grabbed from behind. A powerful arm gripped him like a
vise, pinioning his own right arm to his side, while a big hand was clapped over
his mouth, forcing the lad&#8217;s head violently backwards with a jolt which
for the moment he thought had dislocated his neck.</p>

<p>Tad struggled and fought with all his might, but to little purpose. The boy
realized that he was in the hands of a man who was a giant for strength and who
was slowly but surely forcing him toward the steamer&#8217;s rail. The Pony
Rider Boy felt a bushy beard over his shoulder and against his neck. Now he was
against the rail, facing out over the water. Butler knew that, despite his
struggles, he was going to be dropped over the side. Then a sudden idea came to
him. Tad shot up his free left hand, fastening his fingers in the long beard of
the man behind him. He heard a smothered exclamation over his shoulder, and for
the instant the hand over his mouth was withdrawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help!&#8221; shouted Tad Butler. Then a blow on the head sent him
limply to the deck.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN DESPERATE STRAITS</span></h2>

<p>Tad&#8217;s assailant hastily gathered the boy up. The man staggered
slightly, as, after a hurried glance up and down the deck, he stepped toward the
rail with his burden. Just then footsteps were heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey! What are you doing there?&#8221; bellowed a voice. A man came
running from somewhere in the after part of the ship. Butler&#8217;s assailant
dropped his burden, dodged into a passageway in the deck-house, closing the door
behind him and disappearing before the newcomer reached the door and threw it
open. Then the rescuer turned to the unconscious Tad Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s trouble!&#8221; he muttered. Taking up Tad&#8217;s
limp form he carried it to where the light from the grating shone up.
&#8220;It&#8217;s that freckle-faced kid. Somebody gave him a tough
wallop,&#8221; growled the man. Tad&#8217;s rescuer was Sam Dawson, one of the
Gold Diggers. &#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll fetch him around if his neck
isn&#8217;t broken.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>Laying the lad
down on the deck where he would have plenty of air, the Digger worked over the
Pony Rider Boy for fully five minutes before Tad returned to consciousness.
Butler was too dazed to realize what had occurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you below now, my lad,&#8221; said Dawson.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. Not yet,&#8221; protested Tad. &#8220;Wait. I want to
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was the fellow who hit you?&#8221; demanded Dawson.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; stammered Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he do it for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t very strong on information, are you?&#8221; grinned
the prospector.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want&#8211;want to see Mr. Darwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see him to-morrow. You&#8217;d better get into your bunk right
smart. I&#8217;ll help you down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;ll go alone&#8211;in a minute,&#8221; said Butler,
pulling himself up by the rail to which he clung unsteadily. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want anyone to know. I&#8217;ll tell Mr. Darwood what I have to
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have it your own way. I&#8217;m going to follow along behind, to see
that you get down all right,&#8221; answered the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. I guess you saved me from <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_42'></a>42</span>getting a wetting,&#8221; said the boy, extending an
impulsive hand. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ll go to my cabin. Please don&#8217;t say
anything about this. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad&#8217;s progress below was slow and unsteady. Dawson watched him until
the door of the cabin had closed behind the Pony Rider Boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a raw deal,&#8221; muttered the miner. &#8220;I&#8217;d
like to punch the head of the fellow who would do that to a kid!&#8221;</p>

<p>Butler got into his bunk without awakening his companions. His head ached
terribly, and it was a long time before he fell asleep. The next morning his
head felt twice its ordinary size. The boys joked him on his appearance, but Tad
merely smiled, refusing to say what had been the matter with him. Ned was
suspicious. He knew that Butler had been engaged in a scuffle, but what it was
he was unable to imagine. Tad had been strolling about the decks all the
morning, as if in search of someone. He found the man he was seeking late in the
forenoon. The man was sitting on a keg of nails on the after part of the upper
deck, his back to Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Ketcham,&#8221; greeted the Pony Rider Boy.</p>

<p>The red-whiskered man whirled, letting the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_43'></a>43</span>hand that had been caressing his beard fall limply to
his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beard hurt you?&#8221; questioned Tad sweetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of yer business!&#8221; was the surly reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Ketcham, I know you and I know your game,&#8221; began Butler in a
low, even tone. &#8220;I know, too, that you are the man who assaulted me and
tried to put me overboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what ye&#8217;re talking about,&#8221; growled
Sandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes you do&#8211;and so do I! I&#8217;ve a handful of whiskers
which match perfectly those you are wearing. Shall I pull some more for
comparison with those I already have?&#8221; questioned the boy
aggravatingly.</p>

<p>Ketcham half rose, then settled back again, as if fearing to trust
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be thankful that you didn&#8217;t do it. My companions would
have taken care of you, had anything happened to me,&#8221; Tad went on
composedly. &#8220;I want to say, now, that it would be good judgment on your
part not to try any more strong-arm tactics on me or on my companions. If you
do, you will instantly find yourself in more kinds of trouble than you have ever
before experienced. Now that we know you, we shall be able to take care of you
as you deserve. I reckon you know what that means, Red Whiskers.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>&#8220;Get out of
here, before I do something to you!&#8221; roared Sandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no you won&#8217;t! You don&#8217;t dare raise your hand. I could
turn you over to the Captain and have you placed in irons till we get ashore. I
have proof enough to send you to a jail, if they have such places up here. But
I&#8217;m not going to do that. I am going to be fair with you and tell you
exactly what I propose. I am going to tell Curtis Darwood about you. No, I
shan&#8217;t tell him who it is. I will tell him that someone is following and
watching him&#8211;you and Ainsworth. He will find you out, never fear. I will
give you one chance. Get off at the next stop, and I will tell him after we
leave there. Take your choice. Take your friend with you. I don&#8217;t want to
be responsible for any shooting on this boat. What do you say, Mr.
Sandy?&#8221;</p>

<p>The fellow&#8217;s fingers opened and closed nervously. He attempted to speak
but failed three times. Finally he blurted out his answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you git out of here? I&#8217;ll lose myself in a minit; then I
won&#8217;t answer for what I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; answered Tad laughingly. &#8220;I can take care of
myself. <i>Your</i> kind never did scare me worth a cent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sandy sprang up. He hesitated for a few tense seconds, then strode forward
with Butler&#8217;s soft chuckle in his ears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>The two men did
get off when the boat stopped late that afternoon. Tad was at the rail watching
them. Sam Dawson was also an observer of the scene. He saw the threatening scowl
that Ketcham gave the smiling Tad, and drew his own conclusions, and at the same
time decided that the freckle-faced boy was pretty well able to hold his own.
Dawson really suspected part of the reason for this hasty disembarking, though
he thought it was because Tad had threatened to expose the man Ketcham.</p>

<p>It was after supper when Tad called Ned Rector aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I promised to tell you, Ned. Come with me and listen to what I am
going to tell Mr. Darwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned went willingly. Darwood was sitting on deck. Tad halted before him,
Darwood glancing up at the boys with languid interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I speak with you?&#8221; asked the lad politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon there&#8217;s nothing to prevent,&#8221; was the careless
answer.</p>

<p>Tad went direct to the point of his story.</p>

<p>&#8220;A night or so ago I chanced to overhear two men who were passengers on
this boat talking of you and the gentlemen who were with you. They were planning
to follow and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>watch
you. They thought you had discovered the claim for which you have been looking
for so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Darwood shot an angry glance at the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;From their conversation I inferred that perhaps you already had
discovered this claim and were on your way with equipment to work it. I further
understood that they were to be met by others on shore and that the party was
then to divide up and cover the movements of yourself and your friends. One of
these fellows, I think, overheard me telling part of this story to my friend,
Ned, last night, and the man tried to throw me overboard, after nearly squeezing
me to death and then punching my head. I merely wanted to warn you to be on the
lookout, and at the same time to tell you that neither of the two men is on
board now. You may draw your own conclusions, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned Rector&#8217;s face had flushed when Tad described the assault on
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; asked Darwood indifferently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the Gold Digger, getting up slowly and
strolling forward.</p>

<p>Ned laughed; Tad flushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what you get for meddling with other folks&#8217;
business,&#8221; declared Rector.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>&#8220;I reckon
you are right at that,&#8221; answered Tad. Then he laughed heartily. Nor did he
exchange another word with the Gold Diggers of Taku Pass during the rest of that
journey on the &#8220;Corsair.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>ON THE OVERLAND TRAIL</span></h2>

<p>It was the early morn of a week later when the &#8220;Corsair&#8221; sailed
into Skagway harbor. Exclamations of delight were heard from every person who
had not been there before. This beautiful spot is located at the mouth of the
Skagway River, with mountains rising on all sides, from which countless cascades
rush foaming and sparkling down to the sea, or drop sheer from such heights that
one is forced to catch his breath.</p>

<p>Skagway itself the Pony Rider Boys found gay with pretty cottages climbing
over the foot-hills; well-worn, flower-strewn paths leading to the heights; the
river&#8217;s waters rippling over grassy flats; flower gardens beyond the power
of their vocabularies to describe. Added to this, there was a sweetness in the
air, which, as Stacy Brown expressed it, &#8220;makes a fellow feel like sitting
down and doing nothing for the rest of his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were many trips to be taken from the city, perhaps the most historic in
all that wild <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_49'></a>49</span>country. The boys journeyed out into the interior on
the famous White Pass railway, climbed Mount Dewey to Dewey Lake, and took a
look at the hunting grounds where mountain sheep were to be had providing one
were quick enough on the trigger to get the little animals before they leaped
away. The next morning they turned their attention to the task of purchasing
such of their outfit as they had not yet procured.</p>

<p>Having been referred to a man who kept Alaskan ponies for sale, they tramped
out to the end of the long street on which the stores were located. There, sure
enough, was a large herd of them in a paddock in a vacant lot. There were a good
many vacant lots in Skagway. The boys climbed the paddock fence and looked over
the lot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me for that black one over yonder,&#8221; cried Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the black one?&#8221; asked Ned. &#8220;I thought you liked the
lighter colors, the delicate tints?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do when some other fellow has to groom the animals. For a
labor-saving color give me black every time. With a black horse I can sleep half
an hour longer than any fellow who has a white one and yet be ready for
breakfast as soon as he is.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_50'></a>50</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re too lazy to change your
mind,&#8221; growled Ned Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want the black one, you say?&#8221; questioned Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, Ned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;ll stand by your choice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So will I,&#8221; spoke up Walter. &#8220;The Professor said you were
to choose something in his class for him to ride, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Buy him a mule!&#8221; yelled Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that reminds me. We shall have to take a couple of mules. I
wonder if we can get them here. There comes the owner of this herd. We&#8217;ll
talk to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The owner of the ponies had been expecting the visit of the boys. He had been
told that they would require ponies and did not know that the Pony Rider Boys
had formed conclusions about them in advance.</p>

<p>Tad introduced himself and his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got just what you want, boys,&#8221; nodded the owner.
&#8220;Every one of those fellows is kind and gentle and will stand without
hitching.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t exactly what we are looking for. We are not
particular about their being girls&#8217; horses. We want stock that has the
gimp in it,&#8221; Tad informed him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_51'></a>51</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, that&#8217;s it. You&#8217;ve
just hit it. Gimp! That&#8217;s the word, and there&#8217;s another that
fits&#8211;ginger! They&#8217;re just full of ginger, every one of them. There
ain&#8217;t any more lively nags in Alaska than these fellows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They must have changed within the last minute, then,&#8221; smiled the
Pony Rider Boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you were just telling us how gentle they are, then almost in the
same breath you try to convince us that they are regular whirlwinds. However,
we&#8217;ll let that go. What I do want to know is what sort of mountain ponies
they are. If they turn out not to be good mountain climbers you may look for
some trouble when we get back here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys, every one of those nags has been brought up in this country.
They can follow a mountain trail like a deerhound, and that&#8217;s straight. I
wouldn&#8217;t sell you anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, certainly not,&#8221; answered Butler. &#8220;How much for the
light-colored one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The buckskin?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two hundred and fifty dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg pardon?&#8221; asked Tad politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two hundred and fifty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you misunderstood me, sir. I didn&#8217;t want to buy the
whole herd.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>&#8220;You wanted
five ponies?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there you are. The buckskin will cost you two-fifty and so will
the black. You can have any of the rest for two hundred and they&#8217;re cheap
hosses at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lead them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll take them at that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t said anything about taking them, yet. I said lead them
out. I want to look them over.&#8221;</p>

<p>The owner smiled, but nodded to his hostler to rope and show the animals to
the young men. Tad examined a dozen head, out of which he got three ponies,
motioning to the hostler to tether them to one side where he could look them
over again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with the others?&#8221; asked the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Various things. Some are wind-broken, two have the distemper, and if
you don&#8217;t watch out your whole herd will be getting it. I shall be rather
afraid to buy any stock of you on that account. How long have they had the
disease?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know they had it at all,&#8221; stammered the
owner.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better watch them pretty carefully, then. How old is that
buckskin?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>&#8220;Just coming
four.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did somebody tell you that, or did you learn it from your own
observation?&#8221; questioned Tad Butler sweetly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I know a hoss&#8217;s age when I look at his mouth,&#8221;
answered the man, but not quite with the same assurance that he had made his
first statements. This clear-eyed, quiet young man, he began to understand, knew
a little something about horses, or at least pretended to.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, sir, you have neglected your horse education. The buckskin is
twelve years old,&#8221; declared Butler firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebby I might have made a mistake in looking at his mouth when I got
him,&#8221; answered the owner apologetically.</p>

<p>Suppressed grins might have been observed on the faces of the other boys, who
were still sitting on the paddock fence. They were leaving all matters
pertaining to the stock in Butler&#8217;s hands, knowing full well that
Tad&#8217;s judgment was better than theirs.</p>

<p>In turn the lad once more examined the horses he had chosen, then added to
them enough to make up their allotment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stacy, you are quite sure you want the black?&#8221; he
questioned.</p>

<p>The fat boy nodded.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>&#8220;He has a
slight ringbone,&#8221; Tad informed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say that? I never knew that a ringbone increased the value
of a horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A horse that wears rings must be a pretty classy horse,&#8221; replied
the fat boy. &#8220;Me for the horse with the jewelry. Put a pair of natty boots
on him and there you have an outfit that would make a Mexican part with his
spurs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw!&#8221; grunted Ned. &#8220;Very fancy, but not much good for
real work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stacy doesn&#8217;t mean that,&#8221; answered Tad with a tolerant
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do mean it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We need a pack mule,&#8221; said Butler, turning to the owner.
&#8220;Can you tell us where we may get one or two?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ve got just the critters you want. They&#8217;re in the
yard just back of the stables. Say, Jim, drive out the mules.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were five mules in the pack driven out for their examination. These
started slowly moving about in a circle with heads well down, trailing each
other as if following a regular routine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine young stock, hardy and true and quick,&#8221; said the owner,
rubbing his palms together.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>&#8220;We
don&#8217;t want any quick one. We&#8217;ve had some experience with the quick
kind,&#8221; declared Stacy Brown. &#8220;They were so quick I couldn&#8217;t
get out of the way of their heels. No, siree, no quick mules for
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you need worry much about these,&#8221; smiled
Tad. &#8220;How much do you ask for those fellows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two. I to take my pick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A hundred apiece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t give that for the lot of them,&#8221; scoffed
Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep still. You aren&#8217;t making this bargain,&#8221; rebuked Ned,
giving the fat boy a poke in the ribs.</p>

<p>Tad made a brief calculation on a slip of paper, then he looked up
severely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five ponies at seventy-five dollars would amount to three hundred and
seventy-five dollars. Two mules at forty each would be eighty more, making a
total of four hundred and fifty-five dollars,&#8221; said Butler.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I will do. I will give you an even four hundred
for the five ponies I have picked out and the two mules that I shall
choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Outrageous!&#8221; exploded the owner. &#8220;Why, those mules are
worth half of the price you offer for the whole outfit.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>&#8220;Nonsense!
Those mules have been used on crushers in the mines. Any one could see that by
watching them mill about in a circle&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Five hundred dollars,&#8221; broke in the owner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing, sir,&#8221; answered Tad. &#8220;Four hundred
even.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it four-fifty-five and not a cent less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, fellows. I know where we can get a better lot for the
money, anyway,&#8221; declared Tad with a note of finality in his tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I get my skate?&#8221; wailed Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at the price he asks. Never mind, I&#8217;ll find you something
better for the money.&#8221; Tad had already started away. His companions got
slowly down from the fence and followed, while the owner of the stock stood
mopping his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, take &#8217;em!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I might as well give
them away, I suppose. I need the money, but you&#8217;re getting them for
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wrong. As it is we are paying you a hundred dollars more than
the outfit is worth. Here is your money. Give me a receipt in full. We will get
the stock out some time this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the hardest driver of a bargain I ever come up
with,&#8221; protested the man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>&#8220;You know
you don&#8217;t mean that. If we hadn&#8217;t known something about horses you
know you would have done us to a turn,&#8221; answered Tad, laughing.
&#8220;Yes, I do believe in driving a bargain, but I wouldn&#8217;t ask a man to
sell me a thing at a lower price than it was worth. Just keep these animals cut
out if you will, unless you want to go to the bother of cutting them out
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got my skate,&#8221; grinned Chunky as they were walking back
towards the hotel where they were to meet the Professor. The latter had given
Butler the money for the stock earlier in the day, knowing full well that Tad
could make a much better bargain than could he. Tad had made a fair bargain. He
had obtained a good lot of stock and he planned, furthermore, to sell the
animals after finishing their journey, which would reduce the cost at least to a
nominal sum.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was devoted to gathering supplies and packing. The boys
had brought their saddles, bridles and other equipment of this nature with them,
including tents and lighter camp equipment. In the meantime they had looked
about for a guide, but without success. They were told that no doubt they would
be able to find a man for their purpose upon their arrival at Yakutat, a hundred
miles <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>further on. The
trail to that place, their informant told them, was a post trail which they
would find no difficulty in following. The post rider would not be going through
for another three days, and at any rate he undoubtedly would travel faster than
they cared to do. It was decided, therefore, that they should start out without
a guide on the morrow and make their way to Yakutat as best they might.</p>

<p>The start was made in the early morning, the great mountains and the waters
beneath it bathed in wondrous tints such as one finds nowhere outside of these
far northern regions. The boys were light-hearted, happy, and were looking
forward eagerly to experiences in the wilds of Alaska that should wholly satisfy
their longings for activity and adventure.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>TRAVELING A DANGEROUS MOUNTAIN PASS</span></h2>

<p>To the right the well-known Chilkoot Pass extended up into the mountain
fastness, the pass that had been traveled by so many in the early rush for the
gold fields. Chilkoot a long distance to the northeast intersects the White
Horse Pass. It is a rugged trail, but an easier one to travel than the one
chosen by the Pony Rider Boys for the first stage of their journeyings.</p>

<p>The object of Professor Zepplin in choosing the route to the northwest was to
take the boys into territory that had been little explored, and to give them
their fill of what is really the wildest and most rugged region of the United
States.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; called Rector after they had gotten well started
and had dropped the village behind them, &#8220;what became of our
friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The four gold diggers?&#8221; asked Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;They must have gone on with the ship,&#8221; said Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they must have,&#8221; agreed Stacy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>&#8220;No, they
didn&#8217;t,&#8221; answered Tad. &#8220;I saw Dawson in town yesterday. Funny
thing, but he seemed not to see me. In fact he tried to avoid me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you let him?&#8221; questioned Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Why should I wish to force myself on anyone who doesn&#8217;t
want to see me? Not I. They are queer fellows. It isn&#8217;t because they
don&#8217;t like us, but rather because they are suspicious. They are afraid
someone will get a line on where they are going. Wouldn&#8217;t it be queer if
we were to bump into them somewhere in the interior?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No danger of that,&#8221; spoke up the Professor. &#8220;I heard Mr.
Darwood say they were going out the Chilkoot Pass for a short distance, from
which they might branch off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad chuckled softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you laugh?&#8221; demanded the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I was just thinking of something funny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hear it,&#8221; begged Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather think I&#8217;ll keep it to myself,&#8221; answered Tad,
smiling. &#8220;Let Stacy tell you one of his funny stories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll tell you one,&#8221; agreed Chunky readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave the telling until you get to camp,&#8221; <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>advised the Professor. &#8220;This is a
rough trail, and you need to give it your undivided attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Professor is right. We would do well to watch out where we are
going,&#8221; agreed Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I dread to think what would happen to our packs were one of those
mules, in a moment of forgetfulness, to think he was traveling in a circle at
the end of a sweep down in a mine,&#8221; said Ned.</p>

<p>The trail they were now following was narrow. In fact, it was a mere gash in
the side of the mountain, winding in and out with many a sharp turn, and there
was barely room for the ponies to travel in single file. Above them towered the
mountains for thousands of feet. Below them was a sheer precipice of fully two
hundred feet, getting deeper all the time, as they continued on a gradual
ascent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I should like to be the post rider on this
trail,&#8221; decided Ned, gazing wide-eyed at the abyss.</p>

<p>&#8220;Especially on a dark night,&#8221; added Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or any other kind of a night,&#8221; piped the fat boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; answered Walter. &#8220;On a
dark night you couldn&#8217;t see the gorge. What we don&#8217;t know
doesn&#8217;t hurt us, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>&#8220;There is
some logic in that,&#8221; agreed the Professor.</p>

<p>Professor Zepplin was leading the way, dragging one mule after him at the end
of a rope. Then came Ned with the second pack mule, followed by Tad and the
other two boys. Butler wanted to follow behind the mules so as to keep watch of
them, he not feeling any too great confidence in the worn-out old animals.</p>

<p>The Professor halted at a turning-out place, where the rocks had been worn
out by the wash of a mountain stream sufficiently wide to enable two horses to
meet and pass by a tight pinch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young gentlemen, this is a wonderful country,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of hilly,&#8221; admitted Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the Indian tongue, Alaska means &#8216;the great country,&#8217;&#8221;
added the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I didn&#8217;t know you talked Indian,&#8221; cried Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always suspected the Professor was an Indian. Now I know it,&#8221;
chuckled Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young men, if you will listen I shall be glad to enlighten you as to
some of the marvels of the country we are now in. If my recollection serves me
right, the country has an area of about six hundred thousand square
miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chunky uttered a long-drawn whistle of amazement.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>&#8220;Some
territory that, eh, fellows?&#8221; he said, nodding.</p>

<p>&#8220;If my recollection serves me right, Alaska is bigger than all the
Atlantic states combined from Maine to Louisiana.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where they have the &#8217;gators,&#8221; said Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;And with half of Texas thrown in,&#8221; continued the Professor.
&#8220;It has a coast line of about twenty-six thousand miles, a greater sea
frontage than all the shores of the United States combined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why one would travel as far as if he were to go around the world in
going over all the coast line, then, wouldn&#8217;t he, Professor?&#8221;
wondered Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. Furthermore, it extends so far towards Asia that it carries
the dominion of our great country as far west of San Francisco as New York is
east of it, making California really a central state.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Professor. Will you please repeat that? I didn&#8217;t get
it,&#8221; called the fat boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must listen if you wish to hear what I am saying. Your mind
wanders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope it doesn&#8217;t do much wandering here. I&#8217;ll surely be a
dead one if it does,&#8221; retorted Stacy, peering down the sheer walls that
dropped into the gloomy pass below him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>&#8220;To give you
another illustration, were you to combine England, Ireland, Scotland, France and
Italy, you still would lack considerable of having enough to make an Alaska.
Then, added to this, are the great mountains, thousands of feet high, and one
great river&#8211;not to speak of the smaller ones&#8211;that flows through more
than two thousand miles of wonderful country. I have given you a
bird&#8217;s-eye-view of the country, a small part of which you have started to
explore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a fellow needs a bird&#8217;s-eye up here. He has to have or
he&#8217;s a goner,&#8221; declared Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;And by the way, Professor,&#8221; said Tad. &#8220;Your pony is
yawning with his left hind leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haw, haw, haw! That&#8217;s a good one,&#8221; laughed the fat
boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; wondered the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is stretching himself. His left hind foot at this moment is
suspended over several hundred feet of space. But don&#8217;t startle him for
goodness&#8217; sake,&#8221; laughed Tad.</p>

<p>The Professor glanced back. Afterwards the boys declared he had gone pale at
the sight of that foot held so carelessly over the yawning chasm, but the
Professor denied the accusation. He clucked very gently to the pony. The <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>little animal lazily drew
the foot in, and, after trying several places, at last found a spot that
appeared to suit it and on which it placed the small foot. The boys drew a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, but that was a narrow escape,&#8221; derided Ned. &#8220;Just
think of it, Professor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gid ap,&#8221; commanded Professor Zepplin. &#8220;Look sharp that
none of you does worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now and then reaching a spot where they could get an unobstructed view of the
distance the boys were fairly thrilled by the sight of the jagged peaks,
sparkling in the sunlight, many hidden in the clouds and too high to be seen. It
was an awesome sight and at such times stilled the merry voices of the Pony
Rider Boys as they gazed off over the array of wonderful heights.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are they?&#8221; asked Ned when he first caught sight of this
vista of mountain peaks.</p>

<p>&#8220;The first one should be Mt. Lituya and the next Mt.
Fairweather,&#8221; Tad replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is correct, according to the map,&#8221; spoke up the Professor.
&#8220;The former is ten thousand feet high, the latter five thousand, five
hundred.&#8221;</p>

<p>A series of low wondering whistles were heard from the lips of the boys. It
did not seem possible that the distance to the tops of those mountains could be
so great.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>&#8220;I should
like to climb one of the highest,&#8221; declared Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t,&#8221; answered the Professor sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not, Professor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I shall not allow it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s another reason,&#8221; announced Stacy. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t because you can&#8217;t. But if you did succeed in getting to the
top think what sport you could have!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221; asked Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could do a toboggan slide two miles long. I reckon it would land
you somewhere over in Asia. Wouldn&#8217;t that be funny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; reflected Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t know about it if you were to take the slide,
either. But how it would surprise some of those Asiatics to see a Pony Rider Boy
suddenly landing in their midst, coming from the nowhere,&#8221; chuckled
Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather think it would surprise almost anyone to have a Pony Rider
Boy land in his midst,&#8221; answered Tad with a smiling nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that some kind of joke?&#8221; demanded the fat boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s an axiom,&#8221; spoke up Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;An axiom?&#8221; reflected Chunky. &#8220;Oh, I know what that is. It
is something that something else revolves around, isn&#8217;t it? That&#8217;s
the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>sort of thing the
world is supposed to revolve about. I know, for I read it in my
geography.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys groaned. The suspicion of a smile played about the corners of
Professor Zepplin&#8217;s mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better go back to school rather than be traveling with real
men,&#8221; advised Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that an axiom, Professor?&#8221; called Stacy
indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what is one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a living example of one yourself,&#8221; was the whimsical
reply. Stacy pondered over the Professor&#8217;s retort all the rest of that
day. But when noon came and passed and no stop was made for a noonday meal, the
fat boy began to grow restive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t we stop for something to eat?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to know where?&#8221; answered Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there a place wide enough for us, Tad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But when are we going to find one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know as much about that as I do. Remember none of us ever has been
over this trail. For aught I know we may have to sleep standing up
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>&#8220;Well, I
reckon I&#8217;d just as soon fall off before dark as after. Anyhow, I
don&#8217;t propose to sleep on this trail as it looks to me
now&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad&#8217;s voice was sharp and incisive. He was holding up one hand to
impose silence on his companions. Walter Perkins&#8217; face grew pale, the fat
boy&#8217;s eyes were large and frightened. Professor Zepplin halted his pony
sharply and turning in his saddle glanced anxiously back toward his charges.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; stammered Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Tad Butler. &#8220;It&#8217;s
something awful, whatever it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no fear, young men. I know what that sound is. There is no danger
here where we are, for&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Professor did not complete his sentence. The distant rumbling that had at
first attracted their attention suddenly merged into a deafening roar, and the
trail quivered under their feet. The ponies snorted and threw up their heads,
chafing at the bits.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold fast to your horses!&#8221; shouted Tad. His voice was lost in
the great roar that now overwhelmed them, sending terror to the hearts of every
Pony Rider Boy on that narrow ledge of rock known as the Yakutat trail.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>CAUGHT IN A GIANT SLIDE</span></h2>

<p>Tad knew the meaning of that rushing, roaring sound now. A few particles
chipped from the rocks far above them had struck him sharply in the face. He
knew that a landslide was sweeping down.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to urge his companions forward, but upon second thought
he realized that this might be the very worst thing they could do. His quick
ears had told him that the center of the slide was ahead of them. That was his
judgment, but he knew how easily it was to be mistaken in a moment like
this.</p>

<p>Glancing up the boy could see nothing but a great cloud of dust that filled
the air. His companions seemed powerless to stir, and it was fortunate for them
that such was the case, else they might have done that which would have sent
them to a quick death.</p>

<p>Tad unslung his rope with the intention of casting it over a sharp rock that
extended some six feet up above the level of the trail and on the mountainside.
In an emergency it would <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_70'></a>70</span>serve to anchor him. He motioned to the others to do
the same, but either they did not understand or they were too frightened to
act.</p>

<p>A sudden dust cloud obliterated the trail for fully five rods ahead of
Professor Zepplin, then went shooting out into the chasm beyond, and a great
mass of earth seemed to leap from the mountainside just above them. It hovered
right over the center of the line of ponies for an agonizing second, then swept
down on them.</p>

<p>The secondary slide, which this was, had but little width, perhaps a few
feet. Furthermore, it had fallen only a short distance, so that it had not had
time to gain great velocity. The mass smote the pack mule just ahead of Tad
Butler. Tad saw the pack mule&#8217;s hind feet go out from under him. For the
smallest fraction of a moment the animal stood quivering, then his hind hoofs
slipped over the edge of the trail.</p>

<p>The little animal was making desperate efforts to cling to the trail with its
fore feet, at the same time trying to get its hind feet back on solid ground.
That effort was fatal. Little by little the frightened beast slipped toward the
great gulf. Evidently realizing the fate that was in store for it, the mule
brayed shrilly.</p>

<p>The Pony Rider Boys sat gazing on the scene with fascinated eyes. Even
Professor Zepplin <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>was
at a loss for words, and at a greater loss for a remedy for the disaster that
was upon them. Tad Butler&#8217;s brain was working, however.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tad raised his rope above his head and gave it three sharp twirls.
Then he let go. The big loop dropped over the head of the unfortunate pack
mule.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump on him and hold him down,&#8221; shouted Tad. &#8220;Be careful
that you don&#8217;t go over.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys hesitated slightly. Perhaps they could not have accomplished
anything, but Butler did not wait to see. He had slipped from his own pony with
a sharp, commanding &#8220;Whoa&#8221; to the little animal, which served in a
measure to reassure it.</p>

<p>The lad then sprang to the upright rock carrying the end of his rope with
him. He did not make the mistake of making the end fast to his own body as he
might have done in some circumstances. Instead he threw the rope over the rock,
taking one quick turn about it. He had no more than taken that turn when the
slack on the rope was suddenly taken up and the rope was drawn taut.</p>

<p>There was no need to look around to see what had happened. Butler knew well
enough without looking. The pack mule had slipped over the edge and was hanging
there with the boy&#8217;s <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_72'></a>72</span>lasso about its neck. The rope was tough rawhide, and
Tad felt sure it would hold. Still, that would not save the mule, so he made
fast and sprang to the other side of the trail. The mule, he found, was dying a
terrible death.</p>

<p>The freckle-faced Tad comprehended the situation in a single glance. He knew
now that it would not be possible to save the pack animal. Drawing his revolver
he placed the muzzle close to the head of the unfortunate beast and pulled the
trigger.</p>

<p>The report, in the walled-in pass, sounded like the discharge of a
cannon.</p>

<p>&#8220;N-n-n-now you&#8217;ve done it,&#8221; chattered Stacy Brown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tad, Tad! What have you done?&#8221; cried the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have put the poor thing out of its agony, that&#8217;s all,&#8221;
answered Butler. His face was pale and his eyes troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve killed him,&#8221; protested Professor Zepplin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see that he was choking to death, Professor?
Don&#8217;t you think it was better to end his sufferings with a bullet rather
than let him slowly strangle?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Professor took off his sombrero, and, with an unsteady hand, wiped the
perspiration from his forehead.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>&#8220;Too bad,
too bad!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Yes, yes. You were right, Tad. You did
right. You thought more quickly and more clearly than I did. We had better cut
the rope and let him go. There is nothing else to be done, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something else to be done, sir. There is something quite
important to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The pack. Surely we are not going to send that pack crashing to the
bottom of the pass. We shall have to go all the way back for more supplies if we
do that, provided we ever find a place where we can turn around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so. Still, lad, I am afraid it is hopeless. We never shall be
able to get the pack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it can be done, but how I don&#8217;t know yet. What time is
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The afternoon is well along,&#8221; answered the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be dark soon,&#8221; spoke up Ned. &#8220;We simply must
get out of this before night or we are lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget about the length of the days up here at this time of the
year,&#8221; reminded Tad with a faint smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; agreed Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know it doesn&#8217;t get really dark until <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>about eleven o&#8217;clock to-night. So
you see we have plenty of time in which to get that pack and reach a camping
place before the night gets too dark for us to see what we are about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad stepped to the edge of the trail and looked over the dead mule and the
pack lashed to him. He saw that the pack already had slipped dangerously, and
that a sudden jolt might send it hurtling into the chasm. The lad measured the
distance to the pack, with his eyes, and also saw that he could not lean over
far enough to accomplish anything. Then an idea occurred to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you fellows got back your nerve so that you can help me?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered Chunky promptly. &#8220;Anything but jumping
over. Don&#8217;t ask me to do that, please, or I shall be under the necessity
of returning a polite refusal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t ask you,&#8221; answered Tad shortly. &#8220;How about
you, Ned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I have got over my panic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Pass over two strong ropes here. We&#8217;ll have that pack in
no time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Tad. I am not going to permit you to take unnecessary risks.
Before you go farther in this matter I want to know what you propose to
do,&#8221; insisted the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to secure one of these ropes <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>to me. The boys will lower me over the
edge and I will fasten a second rope to the pack. I will tell you what to do
after that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t permit it!&#8221; answered the Professor decisively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me, please. There can be no possible danger. It is perfectly
simple. Before I go over I&#8217;ll secure the rope to that rock, and in case
the boys let go, which they&#8217;d better not, I can&#8217;t fall; the rope
will hold me.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a moment&#8217;s reflection Professor Zepplin concluded that the task
would not be attended with a very great risk after all. Besides, it was
all-important that they get the pack and its contents, if this could be done
without endangering any lives.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about it, sir?&#8221; asked Tad. &#8220;Time is
precious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may try it, but I shall see to the fastening of the rope myself.
Make your arrangements.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad lost no time in trying out his plan. He first secured one end of their
strongest rope to the rock that already had played such an important part in
their operations at that point. He next fashioned a non-slip loop about his body
under the arms, then taking the second rope in his hands announced himself as
ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take a turn about the rock so you will <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>have a leverage. Take up all the slack.
That&#8217;s it. Now I&#8217;m all ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad let himself over the edge of the precipice without hesitation. There
really was no great danger, but it was not a pleasant position in which to be
placed. He secured his rope to the pack lashings and tossed the free end up to
his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you going to free the pack from the mule?&#8221; asked the
Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we can&#8217;t manage both you and the pack at the same
time,&#8221; protested the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to. Can&#8217;t you folks think of two things at
the same time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can when my thinking apparatus is working,&#8221; returned Stacy.
&#8220;The whole plant is idle at the present moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen! Fasten the pack rope to that rock. Do you get that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First take up all the slack or you may lose the pack after all. We
don&#8217;t want any great jolt when I cut loose the lashings. Draw it up well.
Tighter! There, that&#8217;s better. Now, have you got it so that it will
hold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll hold as long as the mountain holds together,&#8221;
answered Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then watch your rope. Here goes.&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-077.jpg' id="img002" alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>Tad Freed the Pack.</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>Tad slit the cinch
girth. He was obliged to make several efforts before he freed the pack, which
then swung out and away from the dead mule, swaying back and forth for a moment
or so, but safe. The boys uttered a cheer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now shall we pull you up?&#8221; cried Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t be in a hurry. I&#8217;m not done yet. I want to save
my lasso. You don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to throw that away, do you? Pass
me another rope, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was done, after which Butler secured the third rope about the neck of
the mule. He tossed the free end up as he had done with the other line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Make it fast. First see if you can&#8217;t give me a little
slack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; called Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes you can. Try again. That&#8217;s the idea. A little more.
You&#8217;re doing finely. You would make good sailors. Whoa! Make
fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grunting and perspiring, and with aching backs, the boys made fast the
advantage they had gained. The weight of the dead mule was now resting on the
new rope which Butler had fastened about its neck. Some time was occupied in
getting his lasso loose, which had drawn very tight under the weight of the
mule.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what comes from having a good rope,&#8221; said Tad.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>&#8220;Well, are
you coming up? You must like it down there,&#8221; cried Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m almost ready. There, now see if you can get me up. Take up
all your advantage and hold it until I can get my hands on the ledge and help
you a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hauling Tad Butler up, a dead weight, was not the easiest thing in the world.
They drew him up an inch or so at a time, until at last he fastened his hands on
the edge of the trail and curled himself up. The boys took up the slack and made
fast at his direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t pull any more, but stand by the rope. If I slip it
will give me a hard jolt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say it would,&#8221; muttered Ned. &#8220;How are you going
to get up the rest of the way if we don&#8217;t haul you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad crawled up the rope hand over hand until he was able to swing one foot
over on the trail. The rest was easy, and a moment later he was standing on the
trail, his face red, his hair and shirt wet with perspiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; bellowed Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait until we get the pack up. Don&#8217;t waste your breath,&#8221;
grinned Tad. &#8220;We are only half finished.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad surveyed the situation critically. Still he saw no other way than for
them to haul <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>the pack
up by main strength. He told his companions to get ready for real work. The pack
was heavier than Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I can&#8217;t do another thing,&#8221; wailed Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you?&#8221; demanded the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;My heart won&#8217;t stand it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pooh!&#8221; scoffed Professor Zepplin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever have a thorough physical examination, Chunky?&#8221;
questioned Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had you would no doubt have found that you hadn&#8217;t any
heart at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Ned, that isn&#8217;t fair,&#8221; chided Tad laughingly.
&#8220;You know Stacy has a heart. He has shown many times that he has. The only
trouble with it is that it isn&#8217;t as hard as it might be,&#8221; added the
freckle-faced boy with a twinkle.</p>

<p>The fat boy wasn&#8217;t quite sure whether this was a compliment or
otherwise. He decided to think about it and make up his mind later. But he most
emphatically refused to pull a single pound on the rope. They compromised by
making him look out for the stock.</p>

<p>Hauling the pack up was a slow and tedious process, for it was continually
catching on points of rock and threatening to drop into the depths. Great
patience was required to land <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_81'></a>81</span>it safely on the trail, but land it they did after
working and perspiring over it for nearly half an hour. The Professor proposed
that they move on at once, after having divided the pack. Tad shook his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve something else to do
first.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>GOING TO BED BY DAYLIGHT</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Something else to do?&#8221; repeated the Professor. &#8220;I know of
nothing more to be done except to get under way and try to find a safe
portage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to bury the mule, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you. Stand clear of the rope, fellows,&#8221; ordered
Butler.</p>

<p>Stepping to the edge of the trail he glanced down at the body of the mule,
swaying with a scarcely perceptible movement. Looking back to see that the rope
was clear, Tad drew his hunting knife and stooped over, his companions drawing
as near to the edge as they dared.</p>

<p>Butler cut the rope that held the dead mule. The rope suddenly sprang back as
the unfortunate pack mule&#8217;s body shot down into the shadowy pass. The
other boys instinctively drew back. Their nerve was not quite equal to standing
on the brink to watch the sight. With Tad it was different. He seemed not to be
at all affected by great heights or great <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_83'></a>83</span>depths. He stood with the toes of his boots over the
edge, gazing down until a faint sound from far below told him that the body had
struck.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all, fellows,&#8221; he said, turning back to them.
&#8220;I reckon we had better do as the Professor suggests, and get under way at
once. I will confess that this bracing air is having some effect on my
appetite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak of it,&#8221; begged Stacy. &#8220;I am trying to
forget that I have an appetite, but it&#8217;s awful hard work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad about the mule, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Rector
soberly.</p>

<p>Tad nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I should say it is,&#8221; agreed Stacy. &#8220;There&#8217;s
eight dollars of my good money gone down into that hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. He was wind-broken and undoubtedly would have played out
before we got through the mountains. I am glad it wasn&#8217;t the other
one,&#8221; answered Butler cheerfully. &#8220;How is the trail ahead,
Professor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t looked.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bidding them wait until he made an inspection, Tad walked ahead. He found the
narrow trail filled with dirt and shale rock; there were many tons of it heaped
up on the trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, fudge!&#8221; laughed the boy. &#8220;Fate is determined <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>to make us turn back. But
we won&#8217;t! We are going through, even if we have to build a tunnel. Get out
the shovel, Ned.&#8221;</p>

<p>This necessitated undoing the bundle that held all the tools of the outfit,
and also entailed the unloading of the pack on the back of the remaining pack
mule. Ned soon came trotting up with the shovel. He uttered a long-drawn whistle
when he saw the blocked trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;We never shall be able to get through that,&#8221; he groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes we shall. I&#8217;ll shovel until I am tired, then you take
hold and make the dirt fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that all right,&#8221; returned Rector. &#8220;I am too
keen for my dinner and supper to delay matters any more than I am obliged to. We
ought to make Chunky take a hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I wouldn&#8217;t risk it. Before he had finished he would have
lost the shovel overboard. It is the only one we have. Here goes!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad did make the dirt fly. He was a sturdy young man, all muscle and grit. He
shoveled for twenty minutes, working his way through the great heap of dirt.
Then he straightened up, his face flushed and perspiring.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to it, Ned!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned did, with a will. An hour and a half was consumed in clearing the trail,
and, when <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>they
finished, both boys were wet with perspiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we had better walk for the present,&#8221; suggested Tad.
&#8220;We shall stiffen up if we ride in our present overheated
condition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t be much lamer than I am. I feel as if I had a broken
hinge in my back,&#8221; he declared.</p>

<p>They started on, moving with extreme care that they might not meet with
another such disaster. The remaining pack mule was a much better animal than the
one they had lost. He was possessed of better sense, too, and seemed to
understand that great responsibilities rested on his shoulders.</p>

<p>As for the trail, it was the same rugged, narrow path that they had been
following for hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;What if we should meet someone here?&#8221; wondered Walter
apprehensively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back up or jump over,&#8221; answered Ned.</p>

<p>Stacy shivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it at all,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>The Professor uttered a shout.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; cried the boys all together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Land ho!&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>The boys craned their necks to see what the Professor had discovered, but he
was just <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>rounding a
bend beyond which they could not see. When they had made the turn the boys
shouted, too. The trail, they saw, opened out into a broad pass. The ground
there, though uneven, was fairly level, thickly wooded with slender Alaskan
cedar, its yellow, lacy foliage drooping gracefully from the branches. Tall and
straight, the cedars shot up into the air until it seemed as if their slender
tops pierced the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;How beautiful!&#8221; cried Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t they make fish poles, though?&#8221; chuckled Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we wouldn&#8217;t have to leave home when we went fishing,&#8221;
answered Stacy. &#8220;We could just sit on the back porch and drop a hook in
the water at the back of the old pasture lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How high do you think those trees are, Professor?&#8221; asked
Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;All of a hundred and fifty feet. A marvelous growth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can appreciate the beauty of it more after I get something
inside of me,&#8221; spoke up the fat boy. &#8220;Do we get anything to eat or
do we absorb landscape for our supper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon we had better get busy,&#8221; agreed Tad laughingly.</p>

<p>They began unloading the packs at once. By <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_87'></a>87</span>the time the boys came in with the wood the spot had
assumed a really camp-like appearance. The pots were filled with water and Tad
began building a structure that was to be their campfire when he was ready to
touch it off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you find any birch bark, Ned?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you. The cedar will burn all right, but it is a good thing
to have the birch. We shall have a supper worth while in a few minutes. Stacy,
get busy and prepare the coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>For once the fat boy did not demur. He was too hungry, and was willing to do
almost anything that would hurry the supper along. Not a mouthful had any of
them eaten since breakfast.</p>

<p>The ponies were browsing contentedly, but the mule had lain down and gone to
sleep. The day was still bright, though the air had grown cooler than when the
sun was at its height. Still, a warm glow suffused the faces of the Pony Rider
Boys because they had been exercising. They usually were busy, and not one of
the lads, unless it were Stacy Brown, had a lazy streak in him. Stacy was
constitutionally opposed to doing anything that looked like real work.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>The cedar quickly
blazed up into a crackling fire, consuming the foliage. Tad took some of the
brands and made a small cooking fire that soon was a glowing bed of coals. Over
this he broiled the bacon, toasted the bread, and cooked the coffee without the
least apparent effort.</p>

<p>Stacy Brown sat regarding the operations. Ned said that Stacy reminded him of
a dog watching the preparation of its dinner, but the fat boy took no notice of
Ned&#8217;s comparison.</p>

<p>At last the meal was ready and the boys gathered around the spread that was
laid near the campfire, and began to eat with good appetites. Ned nearly choked
on a biscuit, and Tad swallowed a drink of water the wrong way, while Walter
accidentally kicked over the coffee pot, the contents spilling over the
Professor&#8217;s ankle to the great damage of the Professor&#8217;s skin at
that point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, here! Is this a football scrimmage or are you young gentlemen at
your meal?&#8221; demanded the Professor. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen nothing to
indicate the latter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Professor,&#8221; begged Tad laughingly. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you
pretty hard on us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did perfectly right, Professor,&#8221; approved Stacy.
&#8220;Their manners are bad and I am glad you have called them to account.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>Why, their example is
so bad that I have been fearful all the time of getting into bad habits
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned gave him a warning look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; warned Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. I&#8217;m too hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we have been rather rude, Professor,&#8221; admitted Tad.
&#8220;I beg your pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show your repentance by making a fresh pot of coffee, as I have most
of the first lot in my stocking,&#8221; reminded Professor Zepplin.</p>

<p>It seemed odd to be eating supper in broad daylight, whereas they ordinarily
ate in the twilight or after dark. After supper, and when the remains were
cleared away, the boys strolled about, talking. At ten o&#8217;clock the
Professor called that it was time to turn in.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t dark yet,&#8221; protested Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;The nights are short. Unless you turn in early you will not want to
get up in the morning,&#8221; reminded Professor Zepplin.</p>

<p>&#8220;He never does,&#8221; averred Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to turn in at chicken hours,&#8221; objected
Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little boys should be in bed early,&#8221; said Tad smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what they made me do when I was a baby. They&#8217;d tuck
me in my little crib and give me a bottle and sing me to sleep. What <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>time does it get daylight,
Professor?&#8221; questioned the fat boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a matter of fact it hardly gets dark,&#8221; answered the
Professor. &#8220;We shall have only about three hours of real night, I think.
That is about the way it has been since we have been in this latitude. You will
find it more difficult to sleep with the morning light in your eyes than with
this light, so go to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am thinking the same. Good-night, all. Don&#8217;t any of you boys
dare snore to-night. Remember we are sleeping in rather close quarters,&#8221;
reminded Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;One of you may come in with me,&#8221; offered the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you, we shall do very well as it is,&#8221; replied Tad.</p>

<p>Stacy had the usual number of complaints to make. The cedar odor prevented
his breathing properly, the sharp stickers on the cedar boughs poked through his
pajamas and into his skin. He voiced all the complaints he could think of, after
which he settled down to long, rhythmic snores that could be heard all around
the place, inside and out. The purple twilight merged into blue shadows, then
into black, impenetrable darkness that swallowed up the pass and the two little
white tents of the Pony Rider Boys.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh-oh! oh-oh!&#8221;</p> </div>

<p>&#8220;Stop that noise!&#8221; shouted an angry voice from the tent occupied
by the boys.</p>

<p>For a few moments silence reigned in the camp of the Pony Rider Boys. Then
the voice of the singer from somewhere outside was raised again.</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;W&#8217;en de ole black cat widdee yella

</div>

<p>&#8220;Who is making that unearthly noise?&#8221; demanded the Professor in
an irritated voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Stacy singing,&#8221; answered Tad politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Singing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>&#8220;Nonsense!
Does he think he can sing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I shall be obliged if some of you boys will remove that
impression from his mind so that I may go back to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<div class='poetry'>

<p>A stone struck the rock on which Stacy Brown was sitting. Some small
particles flew up and hit him in the neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, you fellows quit that!&#8221;</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Den yo&#8217; bettah take yo&#8217;
umbrell,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kase dey&#8217;s gwine to be wet
wedder.&#8221;</p> </div>

<p>&#8220;Yeow!&#8221;</p>

<p>The fat boy left the rock, jumping right up into the air, for the wild yell
had seemed to come out of the rock itself. At that juncture three pajama-clad
figures rose from behind the rock and threw themselves upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let go of my neck!&#8221; howled Chunky, fighting desperately to free
himself, not having caught a glance at his assailants, though he knew well
enough who they were. Stacy had calculated on aggravating them to the danger
point, then slipping away and hiding until <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_93'></a>93</span>breakfast time. But he had gone a little too far with
his so-called singing.</p>

<p>The boys picked the fat boy up and carried him, kicking and yelling, to a
point just beyond the camp where a glacial stream trickled down, forming in a
pool some three feet deep near the trail.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8217;ll get even with you fellows for this. Can&#8217;t you
let me alone?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>Reaching the spring they held him by the feet and soused him into the icy
water head first, thrusting the fat boy in until his head struck the hard
bottom. He was howling lustily, howling and choking, when his head was out of
water.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll need your &#8216;old ombrell&#8217; when we have done with
you,&#8221; cried Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will wake us up at this hour with your unearthly screeching, will
you?&#8221; demanded Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon the Professor will give you a spanking for disturbing his
morning slumbers,&#8221; added Walter Perkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough, fellows. Remember the water is cold,&#8221;
warned Butler. &#8220;Let him go.&#8221;</p>

<p>They took Tad literally. They did let the fat boy go. He landed on his head
on a hard rock when they let go of him, and Stacy rolled on his back yelling
lustily.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>&#8220;Look out!
There comes the Professor Stacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Walter shouted the warning just in time. Professor Zepplin, stern of face,
gorgeous in a pair of new pajamas, a stick in one hand came stalking toward the
group. Stacy saw him coming. The fat boy bounded to his feet in a hurry. He was
especially interested in the cedar limb with its sharp broken points, grasped so
firmly in the right hand of the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll see you all later,&#8221; muttered Chunky as he
made a bolt for his tent. Either some one tripped him or he tripped himself. At
least, he measured his length on the ground just as the stick came in contact
with his body. It was not a hard blow, but merely a tap of reminder. The
Professor was now smiling broadly.</p>

<p>Stacy leaped to his feet and ran, howling at the top of his voice, and
threatening dire revenge on the Professor. Professor Zepplin was plainly
undismayed, for he pursued with strides that made the merry onlookers think of
the seven-league boots.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, can&#8217;t we arbitrate, without an appeal to force?&#8221;
bellowed back Stacy as he reached the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;We cannot,&#8221; boomed the Professor&#8217;s deep <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>voice. &#8220;This is an
instance in which the punitive expedition must go through.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Whack! Whack!</i>That stick played a tattoo that made Stacy sore in more
senses than one. Instead of burrowing deeper into the cedar boughs, he got up
hastily. In his desperation he seized the Professor&#8217;s feet, giving a
mighty tug at them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, stop that!&#8221; protested Professor Zepplin, laughing.</p>

<p>He reached for the fat boy, but Chunky, with a new exertion of his strength,
brought the tutor down to a sitting position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Retreat in good order, while you have a chance!&#8221; called Walter
Perkins. Three grinning faces met the fugitive at the tent. But Stacy bowled
Walter over, leaped the foot that Rector extended to trip him, and then dashed
for the shelter of the tall cedars, where he hid.</p>

<p>There he shivered in his wet pajamas. It was three o&#8217;clock in the
morning, but young Brown cared not for time. His stomach told him only that it
was high breakfast time. The gnawing under his belt-line continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I hadn&#8217;t been quite so fresh!&#8221; thought the boy,
dismally. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right to have fun, but there are times when a
square meal is worth more.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, the Professor, though he was really <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_96'></a>96</span>enjoying the situation, looked anything but
amiable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try the crowd, anyway,&#8221; thought Stacy, ruefully.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get near the kitchen kit soon. Hello, the
camp!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no response. Stacy emerged from his hiding place and began to sing
the song he had learned from Rastus Rastus in Kentucky.</p>

<p>One end of the tent was suddenly raised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you want another ducking?&#8221; demanded the angry voice of Ned
Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re man enough to give it to me,&#8221; returned the fat
boy.</p>

<p>Ned came tumbling out, but by the time he had straightened up, Stacy was
nowhere in sight. The fat boy had stolen in among the trees whence he watched
the progress of events. Ned returned to his tent in disgust. No further
objection was heard from the Professor as to Chunky&#8217;s vocal exercises.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use trying to sleep with that boy bawling away out
there. What does he think he is, a bird?&#8221; demanded Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds more like a hoot owl, the bird he was telling us about,&#8221;
averred Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll get up. So long as he is abroad there will be no
more rest in this camp for the rest of the night.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>&#8220;Won&#8217;t
he catch cold? He must be all wet,&#8221; said Walter solicitously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope to goodness he does,&#8221; retorted Rector. &#8220;I hope he
gets such a cold that he can&#8217;t speak for a week. Then we&#8217;ll have
some peace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t put it quite so strongly as that,&#8221; laughed
Tad. &#8220;However, I guess he will get the cold all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad dressed himself. After finishing, he thought to look at his watch and was
disgusted to find it was only a few minutes after three o&#8217;clock. Ned
declared that he was going to sleep again if Tad would keep the fat boy quiet.
Butler promised to do his best and went out. He looked about for Stacy but
failed to see him, so the freckle-faced boy sat down on the rock where Chunky
had sat singing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Tad,&#8221; piped a voice behind him, causing Butler to jump a
little. Stacy had been hiding behind the rock, to which place he had crept from
the cedar forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so. I&#8217;m cold and&#8211;and hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back to the tent. You should put on some dry clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t care whether I freeze or not. Go get them for me,
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not. You got yourself into this difficulty, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>now get out of it as best
you may,&#8221; answered Butler. &#8220;There won&#8217;t be any breakfast for
three hours yet. Tighten your belt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I haven&#8217;t any belt. I haven&#8217;t my clothes
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; retorted Tad unfeelingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d you soak me for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A cold bath in the morning is an excellent tonic. Hadn&#8217;t you
ever heard that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had I&#8217;d know now that it isn&#8217;t true. I didn&#8217;t
think you could be as mean as that, Tad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you could be so mean as to wake us up at three
o&#8217;clock in the morning with your screeching. Why did you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I was exercising my voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so. But take my advice. Don&#8217;t use it that way
again, especially so early in the morning. You&#8217;ll ruin it and then you
won&#8217;t be able to sing at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be a catastrophe,&#8221; mumbled Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;A blessing to the Pony Rider Boys community, you mean.
Hello!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; cried Stacy.</p>

<p>Tad was staring fixedly at a rope suspended between two small cedars near the
tents. It was on this that some of the provisions had been hung the previous
evening.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>&#8220;Where is
that ham?&#8221; he demanded, apparently not having heard his companion&#8217;s
question.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ham?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one I hung up there last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I don&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t eat it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad got up and hastened to the &#8220;stores-line,&#8221; as they called the
rope that held their meats and other provisions. He discovered that several
other articles besides the ham were missing. Even the pieces of twine with which
the provisions had been fastened to the line were missing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if this doesn&#8217;t beat everything!&#8221; wondered
Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;It does,&#8221; agreed Chunky, who had made bold to approach. &#8220;I
hope the fellows won&#8217;t blame me, but I reckon they will. They lay
everything to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad did not reply. He was trying to make up his mind what had become of the
missing provisions. He turned sharply to Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, you aren&#8217;t playing tricks on us, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stacy indignantly protested that he was not.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d try to put it on me,&#8221; he grumbled.
&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty bad, I know, but I don&#8217;t steal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop it! I haven&#8217;t accused you of stealing. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>Of course I know you wouldn&#8217;t do
that, but if you have taken the stuff and hidden it for a joke, say so now
before I call the others. They might not take kindly to your joke after your
early morning vocal exercises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t know any more about it than you
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stacy&#8217;s lips were blue with cold and he was chattering. Tad suddenly
observed these signs of cold and felt sorry for the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the others come out, you duck in and put on some dry clothes. You
will have plenty of time. I don&#8217;t think they will bother you. Oh, Ned!
Professor!&#8221; called Tad.</p>

<p>Ned Rector, Professor Zepplin and Walter came hurrying out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there any rest at all in this camp?&#8221; protested
Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I was about to inquire,&#8221; declared the
Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! <i>You</i> here?&#8221; demanded Rector, fixing a menacing eye on
the fat boy. &#8220;Has he been cutting up again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something else this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; questioned Professor Zepplin sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did any of you folks remove the ham and the other stuff from the line
last night?&#8221; asked Butler.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_101'></a>101</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. You were the last one to attend to those things,&#8221;
said the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I helped him tie them up,&#8221; interjected &#8220;Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;And&#8211;and I watched him&#8211;them&#8211;do it,&#8221; added
Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s about all you ever do do,&#8221; objected Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this you say?&#8221; questioned Professor Zepplin.
&#8220;The ham missing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. It is nowhere about,&#8221; Tad informed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we must have had a visit from a bear or some other
animal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would a bear want with a rope?&#8221; asked Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;A rope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I left our quarter-inch reserve rope coiled at the foot of that tree
last night. It isn&#8217;t there now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stacy Brown, do you know anything about this?&#8221; demanded the
Professor sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d I tell you, Tad? I knew you&#8217;d be accusing me for
the whole business. I told Tad you would blame me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go put on some dry garments,&#8221; commanded the Professor.</p>

<p>Stacy lost no time in getting to the tent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>&#8220;What do
you make of it, Tad?&#8221; asked Professor Zepplin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can make only one thing out of it. There has been an intruder in the
camp while we slept. That intruder must have been a man. Bears do not carry away
ropes. Bears do not untie knots and take the strings away with them,&#8221;
replied Tad Butler in a convincing tone.</p>

<p>Stacy Brown poked his head through the tent opening.</p>

<p>&#8220;What we need in this camp is a watch dog,&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>Ned Rector shied a tin can at him, whereat the fat boy ducked in out of
sight.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>A MYSTERY UNSOLVED</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;But surely whoever was here must have left some trace,&#8221;
protested Professor Zepplin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you may be able to find it. I can&#8217;t,&#8221; answered
Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all look,&#8221; cried Ned.</p>

<p>Tad nodded, and while they were scanning the ground he walked about the
outskirts of the camp with his glances on the ground. There was not a footprint,
not a thing to indicate that any person outside of themselves had been near the
camp. Tad was looking in particular for the strings with which the stuff had
been tied to the rope. Not finding these he was certain that some human being
had been in the camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have to make the best of it and let it go at that,&#8221; he
said, returning to his companions. &#8220;Shall we go to sleep again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sleep!&#8221; shouted Ned.</p>

<p>Stacy popped his head out to see what the shout was about. He ducked back
again upon encountering Rector&#8217;s angry gaze.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>&#8220;If it
isn&#8217;t Stacy Brown raising a row it&#8217;s Tad Butler, and if it
isn&#8217;t Tad it&#8217;s a midnight robber.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or else Ned Rector himself,&#8221; added the Professor. &#8220;If you
young gentlemen will excuse me I think I shall put on some clothes. We might as
well have our breakfast and get an early start, since we are all
awake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to suggest that,&#8221; replied Tad. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go
rub down the ponies while the rest of you get the breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we dress before or after?&#8221; questioned Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before, of course,&#8221; returned the Professor.</p>

<p>Breakfast was not a very merry meal that morning. Tad was chagrined to think
a person could get into their camp and steal a ham without his having heard the
intruder. Either he had slept more soundly than usual, or else their late
visitor had been unusually stealthy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I think,&#8221; spoke up Rector after a
period of silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out with it,&#8221; answered the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager that some of these prospectors have ducked in here
and taken our stuff. There must be plenty of them in the mountains
hereabouts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad shook his head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>&#8220;I
don&#8217;t think so. I have an idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your idea?&#8221; questioned Professor Zepplin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there Indians up here?&#8221; questioned Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was an Indian who did this job. No white man could get away with it
so skilfully. If it was, as I suspect, we might as well give it up,&#8221;
concluded Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I kissed that ham good-by a long time ago,&#8221; piped Stacy
solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t agree with any of you,&#8221; said Ned. &#8220;I think
the ham, unable to endure Chunky&#8217;s singing, took wings and flew away.
Either that or it was afraid he would kiss it again. He said he had kissed it
good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wrong,&#8221; declared Walter. &#8220;If Stacy had got that
close to the ham he would have eaten it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; agreed the Professor with an emphatic
nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a bone to pick with you, too, Walt Perkins,&#8221;
warned Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;A ham-bone?&#8221; twinkled Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, a drumstick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The probability is that we shall never know any more about the affair
than we do now,&#8221; decided the Professor. &#8220;Break camp as soon as <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>we have finished
breakfast and we will get under way. Have you looked to see which way the trail
leads from this point, Tad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. That way,&#8221; replied Tad, pointing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Northwest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Camp was broken in short order and within an hour they were on their way.
Though the country was very rough and rugged and the going awful, they found the
trail narrow and perilous only in spots. Generally they found it perfectly safe.
That night they camped in a pass through which flowed a rushing glacial stream.
Tall cottonwoods lined the stream and giant arborvitæ was thick and almost
impassable a short distance back from the stream. The Professor explained that
this arborvitæ was ordinarily found about glaciers, and in cool, dim fiords.</p>

<p>Determined not to be robbed of their provisions again, Tad led a string
through the loops made in tying the meats to the provision line. He carried one
end of the string into his tent and when he turned in he tied the end to his
wrist.</p>

<p>Long after midnight he felt a jolt at his wrist that brought him to his feet
in an instant. Another jolt followed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>The boy slipped
the twine from his wrist and hurried out. The night was not so dark but that he
could make out objects distinctly. There was nothing of an alarming nature in
sight. He examined the provisions. None had been tampered with.</p>

<p>Considerably mystified, Tad returned to his tent, after rearranging his
burglar alarm, and lay down. He had just dozed off when there came another tug
more violent than the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang it! Something is at those provisions,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>Tad once more slipped out. This time he remained out for a long time. He sat
down behind the tent where he waited and watched. Nothing of a disturbing nature
occurred. He could not understand it.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be ghosts around here,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;If there
are, I reckon I&#8217;ll catch them before the night is over.&#8221;</p>

<p>He grew weary of waiting for the &#8220;ghosts,&#8221; after a time, and
returning to the tent went to bed. Three times after that was the boy dragged
out by a violent tug at the rope, and three times did he return without having
discovered the cause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I begin to smell a mouse,&#8221; thought Tad Butler.</p>

<p>He lay down. Again came the tugs at the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_108'></a>108</span>string. But Tad apparently gave no heed to them.
After a time he began snoring, but stopped suddenly, pinching himself to keep
awake. A few moments later he got up quietly and went out. This time he ran the
fingers of one hand along the provision line. The fingers stopped suddenly as
they came in contact with a second string the size of the one he had used for a
burglar alarm and evidently from the same ball of twine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; chuckled the boy. &#8220;More of Chunky
Brown&#8217;s tricks. I reckon I&#8217;ll teach him a lesson and give him a
surprise at the same time. Let&#8217;s see. Yes, I have it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad found a quarter inch rope. He made a slip noose at one end, working the
honda or knot back and forth until it slipped easily. In reality it was a lasso.
He tucked the loop under the rear of the tent, then crawled cautiously in after
it. Great caution was necessary in order not to disturb the other occupants of
the tent, though the boys were sleeping soundly, Stacy snoring thunderously. The
fat boy&#8217;s feet protruded from under his blanket. Tad found them after a
little careful groping. He wished to make certain that he had the right feet.
Satisfying himself on this point he slipped the noose over the feet and wriggled
out.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>Tad then drew
the rope carefully about a slender tree, taking care that there might be no
strain on the other end about the fat boy&#8217;s feet. Using the tree as a
leverage Butler gave the rope a quick jerk. A slight commotion in the tent
followed.</p>

<p>He now gave the rope a mighty tug. A wild yell from the interior of the tent
told that his effort had been successful. The freckle-faced boy now began
pulling with all his might, hand over hand. Stacy Brown&#8217;s yells were loud
and frightful. To his howls were added those of another voice. Stacy was sliding
out from under the rear of the tent feet first, being dragged along on his back
as Butler hauled in on the rope.</p>

<p>But Stacy was not alone. Instead of one boy there were two. One of
Chunky&#8217;s feet and one of Ned Rector&#8217;s was fast in the loop. Tad had
made a mistake and selected a foot from each of the two boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s got me!&#8221; bellowed Chunky. &#8220;Help,
help!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got me, too,&#8221; yelled Rector. &#8220;It&#8217;s got me
by the foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, wow, wow! Help, help!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two boys were fighting and clawing each other in their excitement. Chunky
fastened a hand in the hair of his companion fetching <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>away a handful. Ned retaliated by
smiting Chunky on the nose. Then both grabbed hold of the tent wall as they
slipped out from under it feet first. The tent swayed and threatened to
collapse.</p>

<p>Walter Perkins was struggling about in the dark, shouting to know what had
happened. Professor Zepplin roared out a similar inquiry and sprang from his bed
of boughs. He fell out into the open in his haste, but the night was so dark
that he was unable to make out a single object. He could hear the two boys
yelling at the rear of their tent, struggling and fighting to free themselves
from the grip on their ankles.</p>

<p>The hauling ceased suddenly. Ned reached down and freed his foot, the same
movement freeing that of the fat boy.</p>

<p>At this juncture Tad Butler dashed out from the tent, to which he had run
after having thrown the freed rope away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, here, what&#8217;s going on here?&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something got us. It was a snake,&#8221; howled Chunky. &#8220;Oh,
wow; oh, wow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A snake? Nonsense!&#8221; exploded the Professor. &#8220;There are no
snakes in Alaska.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one here and he&#8217;s the biggest one you ever saw.
Why, he twisted right around <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_111'></a>111</span>my leg and dragged me out. I think he bit me,
too,&#8221; wailed Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody make a light here,&#8221; commanded the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say,&#8221; shouted Ned. &#8220;You pulled half
the hair out of my head, Chunky. I&#8217;ll be even with you for
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the Thing get you, too?&#8221; questioned Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get me? I should say it did. I never had anything grip me like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad was busy starting the fire. The Professor, by this time, realized that
the boys were in earnest; that something really had happened to disturb them,
though he had not the least idea that it had been as bad as they said.</p>

<p>The fire began snapping briskly. Tad was bending over it in his pajamas,
standing as far back as possible to avoid the sparks. Glancing at the others out
of the corners of his eyes, he observed that Stacy&#8217;s face was pale; Ned
Rector&#8217;s was flushed and angry, and Ned kept passing a hand over his head
where the hair had come out. Tad could barely keep back the laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, show me!&#8221; demanded the Professor after the camp had been
lighted up.</p>

<p>Stacy went into an elaborate explanation of what had occurred so far as he
knew. He said <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_112'></a>112</span>something had grabbed them by the ankles and dragged
them out under the tent. He showed where they had been dragged. The backs of
their pajamas were evidence enough of this fact, the dirt being fairly ground
into the cloth.</p>

<p>The Professor fixed his keen eyes on the freckled face of Tad Butler. The
Professor was plainly suspicious, but he did not voice his suspicion. Instead,
he smiled to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going back to bed, young gentlemen, and I trust there will be no
further disturbance in this camp to-night. If there is I shall be under the
necessity of taking a hand in it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If Ned and Chunky will behave themselves, I don&#8217;t believe there
will be any further trouble, sir,&#8221; said Tad.</p>

<p>Stacy fixed a glance of quick comprehension on Butler, and Tad saw in that
one glance that the fat boy&#8217;s suspicions were aroused, too. Stacy was
sharper than Tad had given him credit for being.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN THE HOME OF THE THLINKITS</span></h2>

<p>Stacy did not speak of his suspicions that night, but on the following
morning he was up earlier than the others, looking here and there about the
camp. He was unusually silent at breakfast time, but Ned Rector on the contrary
had a great deal to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody was in this camp again last night. I don&#8217;t know what he
was trying to do, but whatever it was, he made a good start,&#8221; said
Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it was the work of Indians,&#8221; suggested Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised,&#8221; replied the Professor
dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; agreed Tad, &#8220;the Indian was after another ham
and thought he had hold of one when he got Chunky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You keep on and I&#8217;ll say something!&#8221; snorted the fat
boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been looking at that red mark on my ankle,&#8221; continued
Ned. &#8220;It was a rope that did the business. How do you suppose they <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>ever managed to tie it to
our ankles without waking us up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you did wake up,&#8221; answered Tad with twinkling
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;We did afterwards, but I don&#8217;t understand it at all.
Didn&#8217;t you hear anything, Tad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I remember rightly I heard two boys yelling like frightened
babies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once again Chunky snorted, but held his peace. Matters were rapidly nearing a
crisis. Chunky knew that he had played a mean trick on Tad by tying a string to
the provision line and giving it a jerk to wake his companion up, thus making
him believe someone was at the provisions. He suspected that the trick had been
turned on him, but he wasn&#8217;t quite sure. Stacy was covertly watching every
expression on the face of Tad Butler, every word that was uttered, Tad in the
meantime continuing to worry his fat companion. The latter stood it as long as
possible. Then he arose rather hastily and strode around to the rear of the
tent, returning a moment later with a rope in his hand.</p>

<p>Tad recognized it instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, if you want to know what got hold of us last night. Look at
this!&#8221; exclaimed Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; questioned Rector.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_115'></a>115</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a rope. Don&#8217;t you know a
rope when you see one? It is the same rope that dragged us from the tent by our
ankles last night. Oh, this is a fine outfit!&#8221; jeered Chunky.</p>

<p>No one spoke for a few seconds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; breathed the Professor. &#8220;I begin to see a
light.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So did we,&#8221; returned Stacy. &#8220;But it wasn&#8217;t so very
light that you could notice it particularly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned started up, his face flushing violently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to tell me that one of our outfit dragged you and me out
by the heels last night?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who did it?&#8221; cried Rector angrily. &#8220;I can thrash the
fellow who did that. Who is he, I say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I may be wrong, but from the look of his face, I should say that
Tad Butler knows something about the affair. Mind you, I&#8217;m not saying he
did it, but I reckon he knows the man who did,&#8221; observed Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tad Butler, did you do that?&#8221; demanded Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stacy seems to think I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ve nothing more to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I thought you were going to whale the fellow who did
it,&#8221; reminded Stacy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>&#8220;I reckon
I&#8217;ve changed my mind,&#8221; muttered Ned. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have a talk
with Tad later, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No time like the present,&#8221; laughed Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Young gentlemen, enough of this. I am amazed at you, Tad,&#8221;
rebuked Professor Zepplin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell them the rest, Stacy,&#8221; nodded Tad.</p>

<p>The fat boy hung his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I was to blame, after all. I reckon Tad was after me, not
Ned,&#8221; admitted Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What had you done?&#8221; questioned the Professor with a poor attempt
at sternness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I tied a string to the provision line. You know Tad had a line
tied to it with one end around his wrist so that he would know if an intruder
began to interfere with the provisions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, as I told you, I tied another string to the rope. After Tad got
to sleep I pulled the rope. He went out to see what had done it. I guess he
didn&#8217;t find it, for he went out several times after that. Oh, I made him
dance a merry dance,&#8221; chuckled Stacy. &#8220;By and by I went to sleep.
That was the last I knew until I found myself sliding out of the tent on my
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone shouted. Stacy&#8217;s droll way of telling the story was too much
for them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>&#8220;So that
was the way of it, eh?&#8221; questioned Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Stacy says,&#8221; nodded Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you didn&#8217;t mean to drag me out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; the fellow who did the dragging must have gotten hold of the wrong
foot,&#8221; replied Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I forgive you. I would endure almost anything for the sake of
seeing Chunky get the worst of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I like that!&#8221; shouted the fat boy. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad
that you, too, got some of the worst of it. Why didn&#8217;t you tie the rope
around his neck while you were about it, Tad, and make a thorough job of
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Stacy was set upon having his revenge on Tad, even though he
was himself to blame for the trick that had been played on him. The sun shone
over the camp of the Pony Rider Boys a few hours later, and the rough hike was
again taken up. It was the middle of the fifth day after the roping experience
when the boys first caught sight of Yakutat Bay. Huge cakes of floating ice were
being thrown up into the air by the strong gale that swept in from the Pacific,
the whitened ice in strong contrast with the black sands of the beach.</p>

<p>Towering above it all, nearly five miles in the air, stood Mt. St. Elias
glistening in the mid-day <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_118'></a>118</span>sun. Rushing streams roared down the sides of the
mountain, thundering through deep gorges cut into the rocks through perhaps
thousands of years of wear. It was a tremendous spectacle, exceeding in
impressiveness anything the boys had ever looked upon.</p>

<p>At their feet lay the wreck of the rude cabins of the early Thlinkit Indians.
There was no sign of any other village. The masts of a few small schooners were
visible on the southern side of the bay. It was in this part of the waters that
ships came to anchor. Here they were not exposed to the heavy swell from the
Pacific, being sheltered by islands on the southern side.</p>

<p>An Indian wrapped in a gaudy blanket went striding stolidly past the Pony
Rider party.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell us where the town is?&#8221; called Tad.</p>

<p>Without looking at the questioner, the Indian pointed up the hill to the
right.</p>

<p>&#8220;He means on top of the mountain,&#8221; interpreted Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. There is a trail leading up through the trees,&#8221; answered
Tad. &#8220;But it can&#8217;t be much of a settlement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be quite a town here,&#8221; said the Professor. &#8220;I
have read that in the year 1796 the Russians established a penal colony <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>here, having erected
quite a plant. A city was laid out at the time, though I think I have heard that
the penal buildings were burned down. But we shall find out more when we get to
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The climb was a stiff one&#8211;almost straight up, it seemed to the boys.
Three miles of this through a forest-bordered trail brought them to the
village.</p>

<p>&#8220;This certainly is some town,&#8221; laughed Tad.</p>

<p>They saw before them a general store, two or three shops that looked as if
they were for the purpose of supplying miners&#8217; outfits, with a few
scattering cottages here and there. To the left they could make out the smoke
from the new Thlinkit village. Squaws from the latter were sitting about the
village street weaving baskets. Such beautiful baskets none of that party ever
had seen before. The boys could hardly resist the temptation to buy, but knowing
that every pound and every inch of bulk in their packs counted, they contented
themselves with admiring the handicraft of the squaws.</p>

<p>Ponies or horses were seldom seen in the Yakutat street, so those of the Pony
Rider outfit attracted no little attention. A swarm of Indian children gathered
about them, chattering half in English and half in their native language.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>The keeper of
the general store came out to greet the outfit, scenting some trade, and shook
hands with the Professor warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody&#8217;d think the Professor was his long-lost brother,&#8221;
chuckled Stacy.</p>

<p>A bevy of dark-eyed squaws surrounded the Professor. In several instances
papooses were strapped to their backs, the youngsters looking as if they did not
enjoy it any too well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do they tie them up in splints?&#8221; asked Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;To keep them from getting broken,&#8221; answered Rector.</p>

<p>A squaw offered Stacy a pair of beaded moccasins that were gorgeous to his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fife dolee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? I don&#8217;t hear very well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Four dolee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a dollar and fifty cents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two dolee. You take um?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I&#8217;ll take um. It&#8217;s like finding moccasins to get
them for that price.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have to carry them yourself, you know,&#8221; warned Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think I&#8217;m going to do with those joy shoes?&#8221;
demanded the fat boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I supposed you intended to wear them when sitting by the
fireside.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>&#8220;Like the
squaw, you&#8217;ve got another guess coming. I&#8217;m going to send those
moccasins to my aunt in Chillicothe.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was an unusual thing to do. Stacy usually thought of himself, but seldom
of others. Tad called to the other boys to tell them the news. They examined the
moccasins gravely.</p>

<p>At this juncture the Professor beckoned to the boys to come into the store,
which they did after hastily staking down their stock.</p>

<p>&#8220;This gentleman says he thinks he can get us a guide,&#8221; announced
the Professor. &#8220;I tell him we must have a reliable one, for we know
absolutely nothing about the country from here on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Black or white?&#8221; questioned Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, black, of course. There are no white guides up here. I think this
one was out with a government surveying party once,&#8221; said the
store-keeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;He should do very well, then,&#8221; nodded the Professor, well
pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s good enough for our Uncle Sam surely should be good
enough for us,&#8221; agreed Ned Rector. &#8220;What do you say,
Chunky?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I decline to commit myself. I&#8217;ve been taken in on guides before
this. Trot out your guide and, after I&#8217;ve tried him out, I&#8217;ll tell
you what I think of him. In buying guides I follow the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>same tactics that Tad Butler does in
purchasing horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you do, eh?&#8221; jeered Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then be sure you examine this fellow&#8217;s legs to make certain that
they are sound. Feel his ankles that there is neither spavin nor ringbone, then
open his mouth and look at his teeth to be sure that he isn&#8217;t lying to
you,&#8221; advised Tad dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;After which, one Stacy Brown will be reduced to the condition that he
deserves,&#8221; laughed Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;What condition?&#8221; demanded the fat boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Use your imagination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t working to-day. I&#8217;m too hungry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty of crackers and cheese and other things here,&#8221; said Tad.
&#8220;I am going to have some. Isn&#8217;t that &#8216;pop&#8217; up there,
sir?&#8221; he asked the proprietor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; have some?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What flavors have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sarsaparilla and ginger ale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me both,&#8221; interjected Stacy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have a pound
of that cheese and about a peck of crackers. Got anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ginger snaps?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooray! Just like being in Chillicothe, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Stacy
filched a hard cracker and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_123'></a>123</span>slipped it into the mouth of a papoose on its
mother&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>The squaw did not observe the action, but one of her sister squaws muttered
something, whereat the mother snatched the cracker from the mouth of her young
hopeful, cast the cracker on the floor and put her moccasined foot on it. She
launched into a volley in her own language, directed at Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, madam. Roast me all you wish. I don&#8217;t
care how much you insult me so long as I don&#8217;t understand a word you are
saying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish the cheese done up?&#8221; asked the proprietor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Done up? Certainly not. I&#8217;ll attend to the doing up
myself.&#8221; Chunky took a large bite, then banged the end of the pop bottle
against the counter to open the bottle. The stuff was highly charged, and a good
quantity of it struck Ned Rector in the eye. Stacy waved the bottle at
arm&#8217;s length before placing it to his mouth. The charge went over his
shoulder and soaked the Professor&#8217;s whiskers before the fat boy succeeded
in steering the mouth of the bottle safely to his lips.</p>

<p>Professor Zepplin sputtered, Ned Rector threatened, but the fat boy ate and
drank, regardless of the disturbance he had caused.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>&#8220;If you
open any more of that stuff be good enough to go outdoors to do so,&#8221;
advised the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wuz thinking ob doig it in here and shooting a papoose with some
ginger ale,&#8221; answered Stacy thickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will keep on till you have those squaws pulling your hair,
Chunky,&#8221; warned Butler.</p>

<p>The other boys were by this time eating cheese, crackers and ginger snaps.
The proprietor had sent one of the Indian children to fetch the man he had
recommended as a guide, and by the time the Pony Rider Boys had satisfied their
appetites, the guide entered the store and stood waiting to be recognized.</p>

<p>The boys laughed when they saw him.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GUIDE WHO MADE A HIT</span></h2>

<p>The guide might have been anywhere from twenty to forty years of age. The
boys were unable to say, though they decided that he was quite young. He was
considerably shorter in stature than the Indians they had seen, and Tad wondered
if he were not an Eskimo. The guide&#8217;s head was shaven except for a tuft of
black coarse hair on the top, standing straight up, while a yellow bar of paint
had been drawn perpendicularly on each cheek. He wore a shirt that had once been
white, a pair of trousers, one leg of which extended some six inches below the
knee, the other as far above the knee of the other leg. Over his shoulders
drooped a blanket of gaudy color. The guide&#8217;s feet were clad in the
mucklucks worn both in summer and winter. Taking him all in all, the man was a
smile-producing combination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you a guide?&#8221; asked the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me guide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How old are you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>&#8220;Twenty
year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that is about it,&#8221; said the store-keeper. &#8220;These
natives never know their age exactly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You look to me more like an Eskimo than an Indian,&#8221; observed
Professor Zepplin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me Innuit&#8211;Siwash. You savvy me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Stacy scratched his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him to talk United States,&#8221; suggested the fat boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; asked Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anvik. Me smart man, savvy? Me educate Jesuit Mission. Me pilot
Chilkoot, White Horse, Caribou; me savvy all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know how to cook?&#8221; questioned the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heap cook all time. Me savvy cook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t savvy any cooking for me,&#8221; declared Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will think differently about it when you are hungry. Remember, you
are full of cheese and crackers now,&#8221; answered Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been out with the white men surveying, I am told,&#8221;
resumed the Professor.</p>

<p>Anvik nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Big snow&#8211;no trail&#8211;big mountains. White men get lost. Anvik
find, Anvik know trail. Anvik big pilot. Me take um to Ikogimeut when Yukon ice
get hard so man can go safe with <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_127'></a>127</span>dog team. Big feast, big feed, tell heap big
stories, big dance. Oh, heap big time. Innuit go, plenty Ingalik go. Me got
pony, too. Buy um from Ingalik man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;According to his story he seems to be the big noise up here,&#8221;
muttered Ned Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a pony. That is one point in his favor,&#8221; said Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till you see it before you call it a pony,&#8221; advised
Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me got gun, too. Me shoot. Bang!&#8221;</p>

<p>Stacy staggered back, clapping a hand to his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m shot!&#8221; he cried dramatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stacy, do restrain yourself until we get out on the trail
again,&#8221; begged the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me make snare. Me catch big game in snare. Me heap big pilot. Me
Ingalik.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have some cheese,&#8221; urged Chunky, passing a chunk to the now
squatting Indian.</p>

<p>Without the least change of expression the Indian thrust the chunk into his
mouth and permitted it to lie there, bulging out the right cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think this man will do, sir?&#8221; asked Professor Zepplin,
turning to the store-keeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;He will have to if you want a guide. He is the only fellow here who
has ever acted in that capacity, so far as I know.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>&#8220;We would
prefer to have a white man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The proprietor shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;White men mostly are up in the gold country, Dawson, Nome, all
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there gold in this part, too?&#8221; questioned Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s gold everywhere. You can go down and pan out gold
in the black sands on the beach here. But what&#8217;s the use? There is more
money to be made in other ways in this country, unless you are lucky enough to
strike it rich before you have spent a fortune locating the claim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you go?&#8221; demanded Anvik.</p>

<p>&#8220;North. Northwest from here. We want to get into the wildest of the
country and we don&#8217;t want to get lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me no lose. Mebby me find gold, uh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are not looking for gold,&#8221; replied the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are always looking for gold,&#8221; corrected Stacy. &#8220;If you
know where there is gold you just lead me to it and I&#8217;ll be your brother
for life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I take back all I said about this gentleman,&#8221; announced Chunky.
&#8220;If the half that he says is true, he is worth several times the price he
asks.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>&#8220;How much
does he ask?&#8221; inquired Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied the fat boy. &#8220;He&#8217;s
cheap at the price, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you mush?&#8221; demanded Anvik.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have mush. We have bacon and beans, and tin biscuit and
coffee, and plenty of other things, but no mush,&#8221; answered the
Professor.</p>

<p>The store-keeper laughed heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t mean something to eat. Mush means march or move, a
corruption of the French-Canadian &#8216;marché.&#8217; He means when are you going to
set out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were an Indian, Professor?&#8221; said Tad laughingly.
&#8220;I guess if we depend upon you for interpreter we shall get
left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I don&#8217;t understand this jargon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you don&#8217;t,&#8221; agreed Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt if any other persons do outside of the locality itself. You
see this jargon is purely local and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the doctor said about a pain I had once,&#8221;
interjected Stacy. &#8220;But it hurt just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anvik, we would like to start this afternoon, if you are ready,&#8221;
announced the Professor.</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>&#8220;No mush
to-day. Mush to-mollel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Innua him angry to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is Innua?&#8221; demanded the Professor, bristling. &#8220;We do
not care who is angry. That has nothing to do with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He means the mountain spirits,&#8221; explained the store-keeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; questioned Chunky. &#8220;Mountain spirits?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He means spirits in the air,&#8221; explained Butler. &#8220;We are
not afraid of spirits, Anvik.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anvik no like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know Innua is abroad?&#8221; asked the Professor, now
curious to know more of the native superstitions.</p>

<p>&#8220;See um.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On big mountain,&#8221; indicating Mt. St. Elias with a sweeping
gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t go until to-morrow. If you want him you will have to
wait,&#8221; the store-keeper informed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I suppose we shall have to wait,&#8221; reflected Professor
Zepplin. &#8220;It may be an excellent idea after all. We can pitch camp in the
village and acquaint our guide with our methods of doing things, Anvik, do you
know how to put up tents and make camp?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>&#8220;Me make
Ighloo, fine Ighloo. Snow no get in, cold no get in, Innua no get in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about rain?&#8221; put in Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rain no get in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, then. We don&#8217;t care whether the snow
gets in or not, but we don&#8217;t want to have to swim out of our Ighloos in
the middle of the night. One is liable to get wet, you know,&#8221; reminded
Brown.</p>

<p>The Professor arranged the wages with Anvik, calling upon the store-keeper to
witness the bargain and put it in writing. The Professor then directed the boys
to take the new guide out and begin his instruction in the ways of the Pony
Rider Boys. The Professor remained to purchase necessary stores and supplies,
consulting the proprietor as to what would be needed on the journey. The advice
of the store-keeper was helpful in aiding the Professor to take only such
equipment and supplies as would be absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Anvik went to the Indian village to bring his pony, the boys in the meantime
starting off to pick a camp site.</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing, boys, we mustn&#8217;t play tricks on Anvik,&#8221;
reminded Tad. &#8220;I have an idea that he hasn&#8217;t much of a sense of
humor. He might lose his temper and run away and leave us after we were deep in
the interior of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>&#8220;Do you
know, I don&#8217;t believe he is an Indian at all,&#8221; asserted Ned
Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither an Indian nor a white man,&#8221; suggested Stacy wisely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he is an Esquimo,&#8221; spoke up Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the odds? We don&#8217;t care what his race is so long as
he answers our purpose,&#8221; declared Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says he is an I-Knew-It, and I believe him,&#8221; said Stacy Brown
with emphasis.</p>

<p>&#8220;An Innuit, you mean,&#8221; corrected Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, an I-Knew-It, and that&#8217;s what I
did&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There he comes,&#8221; cried Walter.</p>

<p>The Indian was leading a pony that looked as if it had not felt a brush or
comb since its birth, but Tad&#8217;s discerning eye noted that the little
animal was hardy and well-conditioned, though of evident temper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he kick?&#8221; asked the boy, as Anvik tied his mount to a
tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Him kick like buck caribou. Him kick all time, both ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll hopple him if he does,&#8221; said Tad. &#8220;Be sure
that you tie him so he doesn&#8217;t kick our ponies, Anvik. We can&#8217;t have
anything of that sort. If he persists in kicking I&#8217;ll see if I can&#8217;t
break him of it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>&#8220;You horse
shaman?&#8221; asked Anvik.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s ashamed of his horse, that&#8217;s it,&#8221; chuckled
Stacy.</p>

<p>Tad&#8217;s face wore a puzzled look, which a few seconds later gave place to
a smile of understanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you mean, am I a horse doctor? Is that it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what he is. Anvik has got you properly located this time.
Ha, ha!&#8221; laughed Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, boys, unpack. We must give our guide his first lesson. You sit
down and watch us, Anvik, while we make camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>The guide did so, grunting with approval or disapproval from time to time as
the work pleased or displeased him. Under the now skillful hands of the Pony
Rider Boys the camp rapidly assumed shape and form. All the tents were erected
on this occasion in order that the guide might observe the whole process. The
tents up, the boys settled them. There were plenty of trees about from which to
get boughs for their beds, and wood was brought and a campfire built up. This
especially interested the guide. He uttered grunts and nods of approval as he
watched Tad build the fire in true woodsman-like manner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>&#8220;White man
no make fire like Indian. You make fire like Indian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; smiled Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make cook fire. How you make sleep fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little fire close up to the tent,&#8221; answered Butler. &#8220;I
make it so as to get all the heat into the tent instead of sending the heat up
into the air where it will do no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heap good. You good Indian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what he is, Anvil, he&#8217;s an Indian,&#8221; cried
Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I seem to be a good many things in this camp,&#8221; laughed Tad.
&#8220;Any further compliments you can pay me, Stacy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but if you don&#8217;t chase that buck over yonder behind the
Professor&#8217;s tent, I reckon you&#8217;ll lose your rope,&#8221; reminded
the fat boy.</p>

<p>Tad sprang to his feet, leaping over the tent ropes to the rear. A native had
reached under and was hauling out Butler&#8217;s lasso. Tad grabbed the fellow
by an arm and sent him spinning.</p>

<p>&#8220;You get out of here or I&#8217;ll wallop you!&#8221; threatened the
freckle-faced boy. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you try that! It doesn&#8217;t go in this
outfit. Anvik, tell your friend that someone will get knocked in the head if he
steals anything in this camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>The guide uttered a volley of protest in <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_135'></a>135</span>Innuit, which the assembled squaws, papooses and
bucks received in stoical silence, and with impassive faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t seem to be particularly impressed by your
lecture,&#8221; said Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Him no take. Anvik tell um stick um with knife if take.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will do nothing of the sort. We will do all the punishing.
Don&#8217;t let me see you using your knife to stick anyone. Now, I guess you
had better show us around. Take your pony and come along,&#8221; rebuked
Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you want go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, anywhere. You lead the way. Will anything here be taken while we
are away?&#8221; questioned Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;No take. Anvik stick um if take.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a savage, that&#8217;s what you are,&#8221; declared
Chunky.</p>

<p>The boys got on their ponies, while Anvik, after letting his blanket slip to
his waist, started away at a stride that the ponies had to trot to keep up
with.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN THE HEART OF NATURE</span></h2>

<p>That night the Indian slept rolled in his blanket with feet close to the
campfire in true Indian style. He neither moved nor made a sound all night long
so far as the boys knew, but just as the dawn, was graying the skies between the
great white glaciers, he was up and striding, away on some pilgrimage of his
own. He did not return until two hours later. When the boys awoke Anvik was
sitting before the fire with both hands clasped about his bunched knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; greeted Tad, who was the first to emerge from the
tents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; answered the guide.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the mountain spirit willing that we should make a start this
morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Him gone,&#8221; answered the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not know. Mebby Yukon, mebby Caribou,&#8221; with a wave of his hand
that encompassed all the territory to the north of them. &#8220;You mush
bymeby?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>&#8220;Very
soon. We will have breakfast now, then we will get under way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anvik nodded and grunted, then, straightening up, let fall his blanket and
began preparing the things for breakfast. One by one the Pony Rider Boys
appeared, stretching themselves and yawning. A wash in an icy spring close at
hand awakened them instantly. Stacy was the last to emerge from his tent. He
sniffed the air, then turned up his nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bacon!&#8221; he grumbled disgustedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like it?&#8221; asked Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking last night that if I keep on eating bacon for many
months more I&#8217;ll be growing a pork rind in my stomach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to eat the bacon unless you want to,
Chunky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I do. It&#8217;s either that or starve, and Stacy Brown never
will starve so long as there is anything to eat in the shop. Where&#8217;s the
bath room? I want to wash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over yonder, and don&#8217;t you wash where we get our breakfast water
if you know what&#8217;s good for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All water looks alike to me,&#8221; answered the fat boy, walking
rather unsteadily toward the spring, rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p>Breakfast that morning was rather a hurried affair, for there was much to be
done. The <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>supplies
had been brought up from the store the night before so there was no need to wait
for the place to open, and Anvik proved to be quite handy in striking camp,
needing few instructions. He remembered well all that had been told him the
previous day.</p>

<p>They got away early. As before, the guide disdained to ride his pony. He
trotted along ahead, leading the little animal until some five miles beyond the
village when he leaped to the pony&#8217;s back, and with a shrill &#8220;Yip,
yip!&#8221; sent it galloping ahead. This made the boys laugh. They did not
laugh for long, however. A mile beyond this they swerved from the trail that led
up parallel with the border between the United States and the Canadian
possessions and struck straight into the wilds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, where&#8217;s the trail?&#8221; demanded the perspiring Stacy
when the going became so rough that the greater part of the time they were
obliged to walk, leaving their ponies to get along as best they might.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no trail. This is the trackless wilderness,&#8221; replied
Butler. &#8220;There is time to go back if you wish to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want to go back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ere that day was ended Chunky almost wished he <i>had</i> gone back while he
had the opportunity. Time and time again they were <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span> obliged to haul their ponies up the
steep sides of rocks by main force. Fortunately, the little animals, used to
mountain climbing, were unaffected by dizzy heights or dangerous crossings, and
picked their way almost daintily. The boys were perspiring and red of face, but
happy. They thoroughly enjoyed this wild traveling. It went beyond anything they
had ever experienced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you are satisfied,&#8221; panted the Professor when at noon
they stopped on a little plateau from which gulches fell away on all sides,
leaving them, as it were, on a magic island high in the air. &#8220;I sincerely
hope it is wild enough for you young gentlemen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not any too much so, Professor,&#8221; answered Tad. &#8220;I could
stand it a lot wilder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the present rate you will have it that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>They built a fire and cooked a light meal, after which all hands lay down for
an hour, with the exception of Anvik, who sat bunched in his now familiar
brooding position, gazing off into space. As he sat thus, his far-seeing eyes
discovered something, but he did not change countenance. He simply sat in
dreamy-eyed silence. Perhaps what he saw did not interest him. A column of white
smoke had attracted his attention. Promptly on the expiration <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>of the hour that the boys
had given themselves to sleep, Anvik stepped briskly to them, shaking each one
by the shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mush!&#8221; he grunted with each shake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t say that,&#8221; grumbled Stacy. &#8220;It
makes me think I&#8217;m going to have breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heap big mush. Big snow, big mountain,&#8221; grunted the Innuit, with
a sweeping gesture towards the towering peaks of the St. Elias range which they
were now entering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have we got to go through that?&#8221; begged Walter anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Um,&#8221; replied the guide.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how shall we ever make it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mush.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mush,&#8221; jeered Chunky. &#8220;You just spread the mush over
the mountain side and slide. Don&#8217;t you understand, Walt? My, but you are
thick.&#8221;</p>

<p>All that afternoon they fought their way through the rugged mountains, making
camp that night in a gloomy pass at the foot of Vancouver Mountain, a vast pile
that towered nearly fourteen thousand feet high. It seemed to the Pony Rider
Boys that they were a long way from civilization, and Tad admitted that he would
soon be lost were he obliged to follow a trail up there.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>The camp was
made about six o&#8217;clock, still with broad daylight, but the boys considered
that they had done enough for one day. The ponies were weary and Tad knew better
than to press them too hard. After supper the freckle-faced boy shouldered his
rifle.</p>

<p>Anvik gave him a glance of inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; demanded the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to &#8216;mush&#8217; a little way up the pass to see if I
can&#8217;t get something worth while for our breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will get lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that will not be possible. So long as I keep in the pass I shall
be all right. Don&#8217;t worry; I&#8217;ll keep in the pass all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy plunged into the thick undergrowth, and no sooner had he done so than
the giant mosquitoes and black gnats attacked him in force. Tad fought them
until he grew tired of it, then he trudged on grimly, permitting them to do
their worst. After a time he decided that he would get no game if he remained
down in the pass, so, after carefully taking his bearings, Tad climbed the
mountain until he was able to look over the tops of the trees. It was like a
level green sea. He sat down in the sunlight, gazing out over the wonderful
landscape.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>&#8220;A world
of silence,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;If Chunky were here he would say I was
getting softening of the brain. Hello!&#8221; Tad froze himself. There was
scarcely a perceptible flicker of the eyelids as his gaze became fixed on a
point of rock just across the pass. There, poised with one foot in the air,
stood an antelope. It was a young doe, as Tad surmised it to be. His position
was not a favorable one for shooting because he was in plain sight, and the
least move on his part no doubt would be discovered by the antelope.</p>

<p>&#8220;She must have scented me or else she has got a whiff from the camp. If
I don&#8217;t make any false moves she will be over in that camp within the next
hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad raised his rifle slowly. Yet slow and cautious as he was, the
antelope&#8217;s head went up sharply. So did Butler&#8217;s rifle. He took
quick aim and pulled the trigger. The report of his shot went crashing from wall
to wall, like a series of heavy shots.</p>

<p>The freckle-faced boy leaped to his feet, and to one side, with rifle ready
for another shot in case he had missed. But he had not. The antelope had leaped
into the air, turned a complete somersault, and went crashing down into the
gulch out of sight.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-143.jpg' id="img003" alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
He Raised His Rifle Slowly.
</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>&#8220;Hooray!
Maybe it was a chance shot, but it was a dandy just the same. Now I wonder if I
am going to be able to find her. I think I know how.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy took out his compass and got a bearing on the point where he had last
seen the antelope. Noting the course he started down the mountain side, sliding
and leaping in his haste. Crossing over the pass was more difficult, for a broad
glacial stream was rushing through the center of it. Nothing daunted, Tad
plunged in, but was swept off his feet almost instantly and carried several rods
down before he was able to check himself by grabbing a rock.</p>

<p>The rifle had been held out of the water most of the way, though it got a
pretty good wetting. The water was less swift from the rock on, and Tad essayed
another crossing. He fell only once on the way over. This time he went in all
over, rifle and all, but he got up grinning.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter much now. I can&#8217;t be any wetter, and I
guess the gun isn&#8217;t any the worse off, though I shall have to give it a
pretty thorough cleaning and oiling when I get back to camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having been thrown considerably off his course, Butler found some difficulty
in picking it up again, but he found it at last, then guided by the compass made
his way straight to where <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_145'></a>145</span>the antelope lay amid a thick mass of undergrowth.
He examined her and found that the bullet had entered just behind the left
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have done any better than that at fifty yards,&#8221;
chuckled the boy. &#8220;The next question is, how am I going to get her to
camp? I reckon I shall have to tote her.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A PONY RIDER BOY&#8217;S PLUCK</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;White boy him make shoot,&#8221; grunted Anvik.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has shot?&#8221; questioned Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear um.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have pretty good ears. I haven&#8217;t heard anything,&#8221;
replied the fat boy. &#8220;How do you know it wasn&#8217;t someone
else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Know um gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is queer we didn&#8217;t hear him,&#8221; said the Professor.
&#8220;Do you think he got some game?&#8221;</p>

<p>The guide nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see how good a fortune-teller you are, but the joke will be
on you if it should prove not to have been Butler at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>To this the guide made no reply. In the meantime, Tad Butler was having his
troubles. The problem of how to get the antelope back to camp was not so easily
solved. But Tad thought he knew a way. First he got a stick, which he sharpened
at both ends. The stick, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_147'></a>147</span>about six feet long, he thrust through slits he had
made in the hocks of the animal, somewhat similar to what he would have done had
he been going to string the carcass up.</p>

<p>First strapping his rifle over his shoulder, the Pony Rider Boy raised the
stick to his shoulders also, and, stooping, lifted the animal. It was a heavy
burden and he staggered. The head of the antelope was dragging on the ground,
which made Butler&#8217;s labor still more trying.</p>

<p>The lad started away, keeping close to the stream in his search of a fording
place, but he failed to find anything that looked easier than the portage he had
used before, so he finally decided to go back to that. By the time he reached
the former point he was obliged to drop his burden and sink down on the rocks to
rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew, but it&#8217;s hot. And the mosquitoes and the gnats! If it
isn&#8217;t one pest in the wilds, it is sure to be another and a worse
one,&#8221; he concluded somewhat illogically, measuring the width of the stream
with his eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;ll try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The weight of his burden was a help rather than otherwise in crossing the
glacial stream, for the weight kept the boy on his feet, except on one occasion
when stepping on a flat, slippery <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_148'></a>148</span>rock, they were whipped out from under him. Tad went
in all over, with the antelope on top of him, and there he struggled and
splashed, losing his foothold almost as fast as he gained it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am a muffer,&#8221; gasped Tad, finally getting to his feet.
&#8220;I&#8217;m worse than Chunky. I deserve a worse wetting, but I guess
that&#8217;s impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>The journey to the other side was made without further mishap. Then began a
hard, grilling tramp down through the pass, the ends of the pole on which the
animal was suspended continually catching on limbs and brush, frequently
throwing Butler down, tearing his clothes and scratching his face and neck. His
dogged determination carried him through, however, but he was in the end
considerably the worse for wear. The first his companions saw of him was when
Tad fell out into the open in plain sight of the camp, flat on his face, with
the carcass on top of him. At first glance they thought it was a live animal
they had seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get a gun, quick!&#8221; bellowed Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Him white boy,&#8221; answered the Indian. &#8220;Him git
um.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, Tad?&#8221; Ned uttered a yell and started on a trot for his
companion who, by this time, was getting up slowly and with evident <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>effort. Stacy and Walter
followed. &#8220;What have you got there? We came near letting go at
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, we thought you were a bear,&#8221; chuckled Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a deer,&#8221; cried Walter Perkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Him antelope,&#8221; nodded the Indian wisely. &#8220;White boy heap
much big hunter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I am a better hunter than I am a toter. Stacy, I fell
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ye-e-e-ow!&#8221; yelled the fat boy joyously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, let us take him in,&#8221; offered Ned, reaching for one end of
the carrying stick.</p>

<p>Butler shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said I was going to get him to camp alone and I shall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&#8211;&#8221; protested Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let him carry the beast if he wants to. Tad likes to work,&#8221;
laughed the fat boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which is a heap sight more than may be said of some persons we know
of,&#8221; returned Ned.</p>

<p>Tad dragged the carcass into camp, casting it down a short distance from the
tents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Him heap big little man,&#8221; reiterated the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much does the animal weigh?&#8221; asked the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good ton, I should say,&#8221; replied Tad, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>sinking down by the fire.
&#8220;I&#8217;m all tuckered out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better get on some dry clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These will dry in a few minutes by the fire,&#8221; was the
philosophical reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right,&#8221; bubbled Stacy. &#8220;When one side
gets dry I&#8217;ll pry you over with the stick on which you brought in the
carcass. You can&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t do my share of the work in this
outfit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I prefer to do my own rolling. I don&#8217;t dare trust
you,&#8221; laughed Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, you see. When I try to do anything you won&#8217;t
let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps Anvik will show you how to skin and cut up the
antelope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to know how to skin an antelope. We don&#8217;t
have that kind at home, so what&#8217;s the use knowing about it? I know how to
&#8216;skin the cat,&#8217; and that&#8217;s enough,&#8221; Chunky declared.</p>

<p>Anvik deftly strung up the carcass and in half an hour had it neatly dressed,
the boys watching the operation with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heap much good meat,&#8221; he nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, heap,&#8221; admitted Stacy solemnly. &#8220;What are you going
to do with it all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat um.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All of it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>&#8220;Some of
um. Mebby wolf eat um rest. Mebby bear eat um.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebby they don&#8217;t. Mebby Stacy Brown will eat um if there is any
left when my hungry friends get through with it to-morrow,&#8221; jeered the fat
boy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have mine rare, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted Anvik with the suspicion of a grin on his usually
stolid countenance.</p>

<p>One by one the travelers were hauling the ponies up a steep mountain, over
which their course lay, four days after Tad had brought in the antelope. They
had eaten their fill of the meat, hiding the rest in case they should by any
chance come that way again.</p>

<p>The going had been worse than before. It could not have been tougher for
either man or beast. The mountain side up which they were struggling was rough
and rugged. A short distance to the right of them the quartz rock was as smooth
as polished marble save for a hummock here and there, some of the latter smooth,
others rough. Neither Pony Rider Boy nor pony could have held his footing there
for an instant.</p>

<p>After two hours&#8217; toil they got the last of the stock up, which in this
case was the pack mule. Ned pulled on the rope while Tad and Anvik pushed. They
were safe in doing so, for the mule could not kick without going down
altogether. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_153'></a>153</span>Furthermore, it was as anxious as its helpers to get
to the top and have the disagreeable job over with. The result was that all
hands were pretty well fagged out by the time they got to a level space from
which their way led around the base of the higher mountain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Stacy, you haven&#8217;t done much except to give us the benefit
of your advice, so take the mule over yonder and tether him where he can
browse,&#8221; directed Butler. &#8220;Walter, did you tether the
others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, you lazy mule. I&#8217;m not going to tote you. You&#8217;ll
tote yourself if you want a feed,&#8221; growled Stacy, taking hold of the lead
rope and slouching off to the right. The bushes where they had placed the ponies
were about ten rods to the northward of the point at which the party had landed.
Stacy was apparently trying to see how near he could walk to the edge without
himself or the mule slipping down that glassy side of granite-like rocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along, you lazy cayuse,&#8221; he yelled, giving the lead line a
series of tugs. It was like pulling on a dead weight, the pack mule being too
weary to hasten its lagging footsteps. Chunky turned around and taking firm grip
on <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>the rope with
both hands began to pull with all his might. The mule braced himself. He
resented this sort of treatment.</p>

<p>The halter suddenly slipped over the animal&#8217;s head, and the pack mule
sat down heavily. So did the fat boy. Unfortunately for the mule it sat down
with its haunches slightly over the edge of the slope, and down it went over the
slippery surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes the other mule!&#8221; yelled Walter Perkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fat boy him go, too,&#8221; grunted Anvik.</p>

<p>They had failed to observe Stacy. What they were most interested in was the
sight of their pack mule sliding down the slope backwards in a sitting posture.
Alarmed as they were to see their stores disappearing, the ludicrousness of the
sight interested them. The mule came in contact with one of the high
places&#8211;a rocky bump, which bounced him up into the air and turned him
completely around. Down to the next obstruction the animal traveled, principally
on its nose.</p>

<p>Stacy Brown was only a few seconds behind the mule. The two had sat down
facing each other. The mule being the heavier had gone first and, when once
under way, his momentum carried him along with greater force and speed.</p>

<p>With a wild yell, the fat boy, sprawling and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_155'></a>155</span>struggling to catch hold of something to stop his
progress, began the descent. Below him he could hear the rattle of tin cans, for
the pack had broken open. It was raining canned goods down there, but Stacy was
not particularly interested in this phase of the situation. He hit the bump over
which the pack mule had leaped, was hurled up into the air, where he did a dizzy
spin, then sat down with a force that for the instant knocked all the breath out
of him, and once more he shot towards the bottom.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll both be killed!&#8221; cried the Professor in great
alarm.</p>

<p>Tad, comprehending the scene in a twinkling, started on a run. Choosing a
point where there were no bumps in the way, he crept over and, sitting on his
feet, supported on each side by his hands, began a downward shoot. But the
freckle-faced boy did not long maintain that position. A few seconds after
starting he was flat on his back, going down feet first at a speed that fairly
took his breath away.</p>

<p>Ere he was half-way down, the mule had reached the end of its journey at the
bottom of the slope. Then Stacy Brown came along, but not much more gracefully
than the mule, and landed feet first on the animal. What the slide and the bumps
had failed to do for the unfortunate beast, Stacy Brown did. He was a <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>human projectile and the
mule, that had got to its fore feet, promptly lay down again under the impact.
Chunky did a graceful dive over the body of his prostrate enemy, landing on his
shoulders in a thicket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stacy! Stacy!&#8221; yelled Tad as he reached the end of his own slide
and got to his feet. Tad had not been in the least injured by the fall.
&#8220;Stacy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come and help me get the mule up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m strung up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad did not know what the trouble was, but he lost no time in getting to his
companion. Butler gazed, then he burst out laughing. Chunky lay on his back on
the ground, his eyes rolling. One foot was elevated as high as it could reach
and still permit the boy&#8217;s body to remain on the ground. The foot was
caught in the crotch of a dwarfed tree, and was wedged in tightly, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gracious! How did you ever manage to get into that scrape?&#8221;
questioned Tad between laughs. &#8220;Hey, Ned, is that you?&#8221; as a
crashing in the bushes was heard near at hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>&#8220;Yes.
I&#8217;m coming. Is Stacy hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but come here quick. Here&#8217;s a sight for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned threshed his way to them, then he, too, burst out into a roar of
laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha!&#8221; mocked Chunky. &#8220;That&#8217;s right. Never mind
me. I&#8217;m only the fat boy, taken along to do stunts to make the rest of you
laugh. I&#8217;m quite comfortable, thank you. I can stand on my head here for
any old length of time. Have your laugh out, then shoot me! I don&#8217;t want
to die a lingering death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lift him up. You get the foot out, Ned,&#8221; directed
Tad.</p>

<p>This was not so easily accomplished. Butler tried different ways of doing
this, but each time the fat boy&#8217;s yells made him stop short. Every attempt
to lift Stacy gave his foot a wrench, bringing forth a howl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me have your hatchet,&#8221; demanded Tad. Ned passed it over.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do? Going to chop my leg off?&#8221; demanded
Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. It won&#8217;t hurt but a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pro-o-o-o-fessor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep still, you ninny! We aren&#8217;t going to hurt you,&#8221;
growled Ned.</p>

<p>Tad was already hacking at the tree, which <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_158'></a>158</span>was small, but very tough. Every blow brought a yell
from the fat boy. He couldn&#8217;t have made much more racket had his
companions in reality been amputating the leg itself.</p>

<p>At last Butler had chopped through. He grabbed the tree, but Stacy, jerking
on his foot, pulled the tree right over on him, incidentally throwing Tad down.
Then Chunky let out a fresh series of howls as the sharp sprouts smote him on
the face and body. The foot, however, had come free with the falling of the
tree, but the boy still lay there groaning, making no effort to help
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up! You&#8217;re all right,&#8221; commanded Ned, jerking Stacy
out by the collar. &#8220;See what you&#8217;ve accomplished now. You have done
for our last mule. Had you not been along I don&#8217;t believe the other one
would have fallen off the trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Save the donk, but never mind a Stacy Brown.
He&#8217;s a good joke, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; complained Stacy.</p>

<p>Tad had run to the pack mule which had got up, and was standing with nose
close to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t hurt,&#8221; cried Tad. &#8220;He is all right,
Professor,&#8221; he called. &#8220;Both mules are all right. Hooray!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; growled Stacy, flushing hotly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>Anvik, who had
been making his way down by a more roundabout way, now made his appearance. He
grunted upon discovering the disheveled Chunky, and shrugged his shoulders as he
observed the display of tin cans strewn about.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much heap big fool!&#8221; ejaculated the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you addressing your remarks to me or to the mule?&#8221; demanded
Stacy calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; That was the only reply Stacy got, and Anvik began
gathering up the stuff that had been lost from the battered pack. This was no
small task, owing to the way the provisions had been scattered. Butler, in the
meantime, had gone over the pack mule carefully to see if there were any serious
injuries.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a lucky mule,&#8221; announced the lad. &#8220;There are no
bones broken, but I&#8217;ll warrant he aches all over from the shaking up he
has had. I shall have to sew up that gash on his side when we get him
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get started and boost him up, then,&#8221; urged
Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, let the beggar rest. I haven&#8217;t the heart to drag him up that
mountain again until he recovers from the shock. We&#8217;ll tether him and help
Anvik get the provisions up first. Stacy, are you able to work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you want me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>&#8220;Carry
some of these stores up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fat boy shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;My weak heart won&#8217;t stand it,&#8221; he answered. Thrusting his
hands in his pockets he strolled off.</p>

<p>The two boys looked at each other and Tad shook his head hopelessly. Ned
picked up a stone and savagely shied it at a tomato can. It hit the can and
split it wide open.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you must give vent to your emotions I wish you would throw stones
at a tree, or at something that won&#8217;t deplete our stores,&#8221; suggested
Butler. &#8220;Now see what you&#8217;ve done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stacy had promptly rescued the split tomato can and carefully holding it
before him stepped gingerly over to a rock on which he sat down and began eating
of the contents of the can.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to see. Stacy riles me so that I want to thrash
him. I&#8217;ll do it some day, too!&#8221; threatened Ned.</p>

<p>Stacy paid no attention to Rector&#8217;s threats, but having finally emptied
the can, he threw it at Ned, then began climbing the mountain to rejoin the
outfit.</p>

<p>It was all of two hours ere they finished their work of bringing the damaged
supplies up the mountain side. Then came a tug of war in getting the mule up
once more, the brute hanging back, the boys pulling and pushing. The Professor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>had a new pack
cover all cut and sewed by the time they had finished. The boys decided to camp
where they were for an hour longer, then go on, making a late camp that
afternoon, the days being so long that this could be done without night
traveling, which was very perilous in that rugged section.</p>

<p>They finally took up their journey, making camp on a high plateau where Tad
was destined to make an important discovery before they set out on the following
day.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE STORY IN THE DEAD FIRE</span></h2>

<p>It was an hour past daylight on the following morning when Tad, who had got
up early, shouldered his rifle and stalked out of camp, returned. The other boys
were just out of their beds, heading for a spring to &#8220;wash their eyes
open.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad did not show himself to them at once. There was no real reason for his
caution, save that he was a woodsman and therefore always cautious as to the
moves he made. Anvik caught sight of him instantly, and Tad beckoned. The guide
did not appear to have observed the signal, but taking up his hatchet as if
going out for wood, he strode from the camp also, and Butler seeing that the
guide was coming, turned and walked briskly away from the camp.</p>

<p>The freckle-faced boy led for a short quarter of a mile straight over the
plateau, a thickly wooded, rugged plain. Then he halted, waiting for the guide
to come up. Tad pointed to a heap of ashes, the remains of a campfire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted the Indian.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>&#8220;Someone
has been here before us,&#8221; nodded Tad. &#8220;And not so very long ago, I
should say. What do you make of it, Anvik?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see um?&#8221;</p>

<p>Butler nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dead campfire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh. Heap much. What else you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see a few things, Anvik. Of course I can&#8217;t see as much as you
do, but I should say this camp was not more than a day old. This fire was
blazing yesterday. The ashes aren&#8217;t the right color for a very old
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One sun,&#8221; grunted the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks to me as if there had been two men here. Am I
right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heap good. Two men. Leave, big hurry. Him go that way. Stay here two
hour. Wonder why big hurry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they wanted to get somewhere, some place for which they had
set out in a hurry. They had two ponies and pretty heavy packs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anvik nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;White boy much wise. Him see almost like Indian. My father him shaman.
Him teach Anvik see many thing. White boy him see almost as much as
Anvik.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you think they are going?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>&#8220;Not
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they are miners prospecting for a claim.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anvik shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too much big hurry. No prospect. Mebby go get claim. Mebby see um
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we do. It would be pleasant to have some company in this wild
place. They went in that direction when they broke camp. Is that the way we
go?&#8221; asked Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;We follow um trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s go back and get ready to move.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pair strode back without another word, the Indian&#8217;s admiration for
the freckle-faced boy having increased greatly since Tad had beckoned him from
the camp.</p>

<p>Shortly after noon as they were casting about for a favorable place in which
to make their mid-day halt, Ned Rector, who was riding to the right of the
others, uttered a shout.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; cried Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been a campfire here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you find it?&#8221; wondered Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;My pony walked through it and kicked up the ashes. Who do you suppose
it could have been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure I don&#8217;t know. See anything about the remains of the
fire that tells you anything?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>&#8220;No. What
is there to see, Tad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It takes a woodsman to see things,&#8221; declared Stacy Brown,
getting from his saddle and gravely strolling to the heap of ashes, into which
he thrust one hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; grinned Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ashes warm. Haven&#8217;t been away from here very long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great!&#8221; cried the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a wonder,&#8221; nodded Butler approvingly. &#8220;But you all
missed the other one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The other what?&#8221; demanded Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;The other campfire. There was another right near where we camped last
night. In that case the ashes were cold. The travelers haven&#8217;t made as
much progress to-day as I should have thought they would, and it looks to me as
though they thought they were moving rather too rapidly and had slowed down a
little. What do you say, Anvik?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; grunted the Indian, which Tad interpreted as meaning that
he was right.</p>

<p>The Professor was much interested in the discovery, and asked Tad and Anvik
many questions about the earlier discovery. Still, there was not much to be
learned. A stranger in this wild place was something to attract the attention
and cause speculation and discussion, so during the rest hour they talked of
little <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>else. Tad
thought they would come up with the two strangers, but the guide shook his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Him go north. Anvik go northwest. No see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see by to-morrow. I have an idea that we are going to catch
up with our friends before we get across the mountains,&#8221; averred Tad
confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lunch is ready,&#8221; announced the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;And speaking of food, I&#8217;m a little hungry myself,&#8221; said
Tad with a laugh. &#8220;I really am glad there is no one in our outfit with a
delicate appetite. Walt, do you remember what a dainty picker you were when we
first went out together?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I have changed since then, haven&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say you have. From a delicate little chap you&#8217;ve gotten
to be a regular whopper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I reckon we&#8217;ve all grown some,&#8221; agreed Chunky.
&#8220;But if this kind of going continues we&#8217;ll all shrink away to
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be able to lift a house after you have finished this
journey,&#8221; laughed Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to lift a house. I&#8217;ve got all I can do to
lift myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon after, the party started on, to meet with a surprise ere they had gone
far on their journey.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>A SIGN FROM THE MOUNTAIN TOP</span></h2>

<p>The surprise did not come until just before night closed in, shortly after
ten o&#8217;clock that night.</p>

<p>A hard, grilling day had been spent on the trail, with little relief from
their labors, which were divided between hauling the ponies up dangerous slopes,
down almost sheer walls, across glacial streams cold as ice, and last but not
least the fighting of giant mosquitoes and black gnats.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one thing lacking to make this country the limit,&#8221;
declared Stacy after they had made camp and settled down to warm themselves
while the guide was getting supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what might that be?&#8221; questioned the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Snakes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank goodness there aren&#8217;t any such things here,&#8221;
exclaimed Rector. &#8220;It is bad enough as it is. Hark! What&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Him wolf,&#8221; grunted the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say there were several of &#8216;him,&#8217;&#8221; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>laughed Tad Butler.
&#8220;They seemed to be stirred up about something. Are they timber wolves,
Anvik?&#8221;</p>

<p>The guide nodded and grunted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you afraid of wolves?&#8221; demanded Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;No &#8217;fraid wolves. Mebby &#8217;fraid Ingalik.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad drew from this that the Indian had something in mind that he had not
spoken to them about. The freckle-faced boy eyed the Indian keenly, but
Anvik&#8217;s impassive face told him nothing. The guide had discovered
something else. Tad was sure of that, but what that something was the boy had
not the slightest idea.</p>

<p>Tad&#8217;s gaze roved about over the landscape, traveling slowly from
mountain to mountain, from peak to peak. Twice he went over the rugged landscape
spread out before them with his searching glances. Suddenly his gaze halted and
fixed on the peak of a low mountain off to the northwest of them. Butler shaded
his eyes, and Anvik, observing the action, followed the direction of the
boy&#8217;s gaze.</p>

<p>The guide made no move, nor did he change expression, but Tad saw that Anvik
saw. A tiny ring of smoke was rising slowly from the low mountain peak, swaying
lazily as it rose in the quiet air. It was almost white. One <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>might have taken it for a
cloud did he not know better, and only a mountaineer would have known
better.</p>

<p>A moment and a second ring ascended in the wake of the first one, then after
another interval a third ring rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you looking at?&#8221; demanded the Professor sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smoke,&#8221; answered Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On that low peak. Where are the glasses?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ned hurriedly fetched the glasses. He took the first look, but saw no smoke.
Tad reached for them. By this time another ring was rising. It, like the first
one he had seen, was followed by two others.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a signal!&#8221; announced Butler quietly. &#8220;Now what
can it mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means trouble for us,&#8221; spoke up Stacy. &#8220;I can feel it
in my bones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who would desire to make trouble for us here?&#8221; demanded the
Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Tad. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
that smoke has anything to do with us. It must be an Indian signal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No Indian,&#8221; grunted Anvik. &#8220;Him white man
smoke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; questioned the Professor sharply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>&#8220;Me
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then perhaps you may be able to tell us whose smoke it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Him white man. Mebby same man, mebby not. White man all same. Him call
other white man. Him say some along, by jink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make a smoke and answer him,&#8221; suggested Ned eagerly.
&#8220;That would be a joke on him, whoever he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad said &#8220;no,&#8221; and said it emphatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;No make smoke,&#8221; agreed the Indian. &#8220;Smoke want white man
off yonder&#8221;&#8211;pointing to the southwest.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; asked Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smoke him go that way. Want us, smoke him go this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never knew that before,&#8221; reflected Tad. &#8220;You see, boys,
they make these signal smokes by building a smudge, then holding a blanket over
the smudge. By removing the blanket and replacing it they can make a definite
number of smokes, long smokes or short smokes; in fact, they can almost make
words, like the telegraph. It is a wonderful thing. I wouldn&#8217;t be
surprised if those signals could be made out twenty or thirty miles away, if one
had eyes sharp enough to detect them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what are they signaling for?&#8221; demanded Stacy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>&#8220;I
don&#8217;t know. Anvik says it is white men. I can&#8217;t tell you anything
about that. Smoke is just smoke to me. They are communicating with someone. We
shan&#8217;t see them, as they must be all of ten miles away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifteen,&#8221; corrected the guide.</p>

<p>&#8220;That shows how poorly a novice judges distances in this
country,&#8221; nodded Butler. &#8220;They may see our fire to-night. If they
are friendly we shall no doubt meet them. If they are not, we may never see a
sign of them again. That is the way I reason it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anvik grunted and nodded. The Indian understood a great deal more of what was
being said than one would have supposed. In fact, to look at him one would not
think he had even heard anything of what was being said about him. He was the
silent, impassive-faced stoic of his race.</p>

<p>After darkness had set in the boys scanned the mountains for the light of a
campfire, but there was no light to be seen. The Pony Rider Boys&#8217;
campfire, however, was blazing up brightly, they having built up a large fire on
purpose to attract the attention of the men who had made the smoke signals from
the low mountain peak, low in comparison with the ten and fifteen thousand feet
ranges about them. The boys turned in at midnight, a late hour for <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>them, and were sound
asleep within two minutes thereafter. They were aroused an hour later by the
most terrifying roar they had ever listened to.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; cried Tad, springing from his tent,
trying to pierce the darkness with his gaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&#8211;is the world coming to an end?&#8221; yelled Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess the mountain is falling down,&#8221; shouted Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guide, guide!&#8221; roared the Professor.</p>

<p>Anvik, drawing his blanket still more closely about him, stepped over and
threw some fresh sticks on the fire. The roaring by this time had become a
thunderous, crashing noise that fairly deafened them. One had to shout to make
himself heard. Fine particles, like sharp stones, began raining down upon them,
stinging the faces, causing the boys to shield their eyes with their arms.
Stacy, in alarm, ran and hid in the tent; the others stood their ground, yet not
knowing what second they might be caught in what seemed to them to be a great
upheaval of nature.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an earthquake,&#8221; shouted Ned Rector.</p>

<p>Stacy heard the words in a brief lull. The fat boy burst from his tent
yelling like a wild Indian.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>&#8220;An
earthquake! Oh, wow, wow, wow! We&#8217;ll all be shot to pieces. Oh,
help!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad grabbed the boy by a shoulder, giving him a good shaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that noise!&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;Don&#8217;t yell until
you are hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to yell now. Maybe I can&#8217;t yell after I&#8217;m
hurt,&#8221; returned Chunky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guide! What is it?&#8221; roared the Professor, the perspiration
standing out over his face, as Tad observed when the fire blazed up.</p>

<p>Anvik finished what he was doing before he answered. Then he spoke without
looking up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Him mountain fall down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it an ice slide?&#8221; shouted Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An avalanche, do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; an ice-avalanche,&#8221; explained the Professor. &#8220;I have
seen them in other parts of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sun make him ice weak; ice fall down,&#8221; explained Anvik.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about danger for us?&#8221; asked Walter.</p>

<p>For answer the Indian shrugged his shoulders and went on poking the fire.
Then, of a sudden, there came a crash like a salvo of artillery. A crushing,
grinding mass shot by them, snuffing out the fire as it passed.</p>

<p>Darkness and a terrifying silence followed.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN UNEXPECTED MEETING</span></h2>

<p>After the roar of the passing avalanche had ceased, and the awed silence
became oppressive, Stacy Brown&#8217;s voice was heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ow-wow!&#8221; he wailed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we all here, and safe?&#8221; called Tad. &#8220;Professor, Ned,
Walter, Anvik!&#8221;</p>

<p>Each answered to his name.</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t call for me,&#8221; Chunky protested indignantly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t I count in this outfit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; answered Tad. &#8220;When you&#8217;re not
making a noise we know you&#8217;re somewhere else. Let&#8217;s see what the ice
did to our camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heap one piece ice fall,&#8221; grunted the guide. &#8220;Him sit on
fire. Innua him mad, by jink!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Innua the scoundrel who has been throwing sections of mountains at
us?&#8221; demanded Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;He means the mountain spirit,&#8221; explained Tad. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you recall that Anvik wouldn&#8217;t start out with us the first day because he
said <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>the mountain
spirit was in a blue funk, or something of the sort?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Innua must have been in a rage to-night then, and we are lucky
that we weren&#8217;t in range of his projectiles,&#8221; chuckled Tad.</p>

<p>Beyond destroying their fire, no damage had been done to the camp. However,
after the excitement no one felt like sleep, so the boys sat about the fire
discussing the ice avalanche for an hour or more. Then, at the Professor&#8217;s
urgent insistence, they turned in. Anvik long since had wound himself up in his
blanket and gone to sleep.</p>

<p>Just as the dawn was graying, Tad got up, and shouldering his rifle slipped
from the camp unobserved by anyone except the Indian. Anvik opened one eye,
regarded the boy inquiringly, then closing the eye, dozed off. He was by this
time too well used to Tad&#8217;s morning excursions to ask any questions. He
knew the boy was well able to take care of himself.</p>

<p>Tad had a two-fold purpose in view in going out this morning. He wanted to
get some fresh meat for the outfit and he also was curious to know what the
smoke of the previous evening had meant. While he did not expect to come up with
any strangers, he thought that, perhaps he might discover something.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>Tad did. He had
proceeded less than a mile from camp when he smelled smoke. At first he thought
the odor must come from his own camp, then he saw that the slight breeze was
from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;That means that someone isn&#8217;t far ahead of me. It means I am
going to find out who it is if I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>After floundering about for fully half an hour, with the odor of smoke
becoming more pungent all the time, the boy was on the point of confessing that
he was beaten, when all at once he caught the sound of a human voice. The voice
was not loud enough to enable him to distinguish the words, but he was quite
sure it was the voice of a white man and not far away at that.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have masked their camp. That&#8217;s why I haven&#8217;t been
able to find them,&#8221; muttered the boy, starting ahead again. After creeping
forward cautiously for some time, a wave of suffocating smoke from burning wood
smote him full in the face.</p>

<p>Tad uttered a loud sneeze. Two men suddenly appeared in the haze of smoke,
and the boy heard the sound of hands slapping pistol holsters. He was able to
make the men out faintly, but not with sufficient clearness to see who or what
they were.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>&#8220;Hold on,
boys&#8211;don&#8217;t shoot!&#8221; warned Butler, as he stepped around the
smudge to enable him to get a better view of the men whom he had come upon so
unexpectedly, to them.</p>

<p>Before him stood Curtis Darwood and Dill Bruce, the latter known among his
companions as the Pickle. Each man held his revolver ready for quick action.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how do you do?&#8221; smiled Tad. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t the least
idea I should find anyone I knew.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, suffering blue jays, if it isn&#8217;t old Spotted Face!&#8221;
exclaimed Bruce. &#8220;Howdy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good. How are you?&#8221; Tad stepped forward. Bruce shook hands
cordially with the boy. Tad turned to Darwood, who had not said a word. The
latter&#8217;s face darkened, and he appeared not to have observed the hand that
Tad extended toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to shake hands with me, Mr. Darwood?&#8221;
asked the lad.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon you ought to know better than to ask it,&#8221; returned the
gold digger. &#8220;I reckon, further, that if you know what&#8217;s good for
you you&#8217;ll be mushing out of this as fast as your legs will carry you,
unless you are looking for trouble. Git!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN UNFRIENDLY RECEPTION</span></h2>

<p>Tad gazed at the gold digger in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I don&#8217;t understand, Mr. Darwood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand plain English? I said &#8216;git.&#8217; We
don&#8217;t want anything to do with you, and if we find you fooling about our
outfit after this we&#8217;ll try something else to keep you away,&#8221; warned
the prospector.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you appear to have taken such a dislike to me.
I am sure I have done nothing to merit it. However, I am equally sure that I
don&#8217;t want anything to do with you. If you change your mind and can act
like a man, instead of a kid, I shall be glad to see you. But don&#8217;t get
funny. We may be boys but we are quite able to take care of ourselves,&#8221;
answered Tad, turning away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221;</p>

<p>Darwood&#8217;s voice was stern. Tad halted and turned towards the two
men.</p>

<p>&#8220;You reckon you&#8217;re mighty smart, I know, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>but you must think I&#8217;m a
natural-born fool not to know that you have been following us all the way up
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you needn&#8217;t play the innocent dodge. You know what I
mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8211;you think we have been following you?&#8221; questioned the
boy, scarcely able to believe that the prospector was in earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think. I know. You&#8217;re like all the rest of them.
We have had this thing happen to us before. There are plenty more like you, and
they&#8217;ve followed us, hoping they will be the first to discover the bear
totem and the claim that we are in search of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Taku Pass?&#8221; asked Butler with a half smile on his face.</p>

<p>Darwood&#8217;s face flushed angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I tell you, Bruce?&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;Are you
going?&#8221; he demanded, turning towards Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I don&#8217;t care to stay where I&#8217;m not wanted. But before
going I am going to tell you something. We are not prospecting, nor following
prospectors. We are taking our usual summer vacation on horseback. All I know
about your affairs is what Captain Petersen of the &#8216;Corsair&#8217; told me, and
what I overheard from Sandy Ketcham. If you will recall <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>I told you about that. The Captain gave
me your history as far as he knew it, and I was much interested. How could I
help being? I love adventure and so do my companions. We wanted to know more
about it, but did not think it was any of our business until I overheard Ketcham
plotting against you. We hadn&#8217;t the least idea we ever should see you
again. My finding you this morning was a pure accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you happen to do it?&#8221; interjected Dill Bruce.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw your smoke signs last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>

<p>Darwood snapped the word out like the crack of a whip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw your smoke signs. At least I suppose they were yours. This
morning I started out, as I frequently do, in search of game. I smelled your
smoke and out of curiosity hunted you up to see who our neighbors were.
That&#8217;s all there is to it. If you can get anything out of that you are
welcome to it. I wish you luck in finding Taku Pass. If I should stumble on it,
I&#8217;ll look you up and let you know. We aren&#8217;t looking for gold mines
especially. &#8217;Bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what d&#8217;ye think of that?&#8221; grinned the Pickle after
Tad had left them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think somebody will get hurt if they don&#8217;t leave us
alone,&#8221; growled Darwood, caressing <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_181'></a>181</span>the butt of his revolver. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting
tired of this kind of nagging.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That outfit isn&#8217;t nagging you,&#8221; answered Bruce.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are nothing but boys. At least one of them is the right sort.
Spotted Face did us a favor. He isn&#8217;t a crook.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t said he was. But you don&#8217;t know who is in their
outfit now. Besides, there isn&#8217;t one chance in a thousand that
they&#8217;d be so close on our trail unless they had followed us on purpose.
No, this business must be stopped. We may be on the right track, and if we are
we must protect ourselves, and we&#8217;ll do it, even though we have to kill a
few curious hounds who are following the trail. The boy business may be merely a
mask for the operations of some other persons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you find out, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Darwood bent a keen gaze on his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hunt up their camp and see what is going on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; answered the gold digger with emphasis.
&#8220;What&#8217;s more, I&#8217;ll do it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk! If you hurry, you may be able to find the boy
and follow him in. Shall I go along?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>&#8220;No. You
stay here and look after things. I may be away for some time. I don&#8217;t know
where they are, but I&#8217;ll find them if it takes all day. If our two
comrades come in, you hold them here. Needn&#8217;t tell them where I
am.&#8221;</p>

<p>Darwood shouldered his rifle and strode from his camp without another word.
Bruce replenished the fire in order to make a smudge that could be smelled for
some distance away, which was for the purpose of directing their companions to
them, and also had served to call Tad Butler into their camp in advance of the
other two gold diggers.</p>

<p>Tad was out of sight by the time Curtis Darwood got out, but Darwood was able
to follow the boy&#8217;s trail, though it was not an easy one. Tad had made no
effort to mask his trail, but his natural instincts taught him to leave as few
indications of his progress as possible. Darwood saw this. Instead of lessening
his suspicions this fact served to increase them. The gold digger was using his
nose more than his eyes, sniffing the air for the smoke from the camp of the
Pony Rider Boys&#8217; outfit. He caught the scent after half an hour or so of
trudging over the hard trail. From this time on it was easy so far as finding
his way was concerned. Butler, knowing the way, had made much better time back
to his own camp.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>Breakfast was
ready by the time he reached there. Tad did not mention his experience, not
having decided what he would do in this matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You find big smoke?&#8221; questioned the Indian as Tad stood over him
by the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered the lad carelessly. Anvik shrewdly deduced that
Butler had made some sort of discovery, but he asked no further questions.
Perhaps the guide also had discovered that they had near neighbors. If so he
kept that fact to himself.</p>

<p>The boys sat down to breakfast. They discussed the day&#8217;s ride and
talked of their further journeyings, though Tad had little to say that morning.
He was thinking deeply on what had just occurred.</p>

<p>The breakfast was about half finished when the lad flashed a quick, keen
glance in the direction from which he had entered the camp. The others did not
observe his sharp glance of inquiry. Tad had seen something. A movement of the
foliage had attracted his observant eyes. He glanced at Anvik, who was sitting
with his back to the party, gazing off over the mountains to the rear of them
and through which they had worked their way to the present camping place.</p>

<p>Tad casually reached over for his rifle that was standing against a rock.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_184'></a>184</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; demanded Ned
sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to examine my gun,&#8221; replied the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Funny time to examine it when eating your breakfast,&#8221; spoke up
Walter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer to eat,&#8221; said Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We know that,&#8221; chuckled Ned. &#8220;No need for you to tell
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Professor was eyeing Tad inquiringly, observing that the boy&#8217;s face
was slightly flushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Tad?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, except that I am going to take a pot shot at an
intruder,&#8221; replied the boy calmly, suddenly leveling his rifle on the
bushes where he had observed the movement a few moments before.</p>

<p>He pulled the trigger. A deafening crash brought the boys to their feet,
yelling. The shot was followed by a shout from the bushes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that shooting, you fool!&#8221; roared a voice. Tad put down his
gun, grinning broadly, the others dancing about excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come out of that or I&#8217;ll give you something to yell at,&#8221;
commanded the Pony Rider Boy.</p>

Curtis Darwood Stepped Out.
</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>Curtis Darwood,
his face stern and determined, stepped out into the open and walked straight
towards the amazed group now standing near the campfire. The Indian guide was
the only person who had not gotten up when Tad Butler sent a bullet into the
thicket fully six feet above the head of the gold digger who was spying on the
camp.</p>

<p>Darwood was more angry at having been discovered than being shot at. He had
heard the bullet rip through the foliage above his head, and knew that the shot
had been intended to stir him up rather than to reach him. That the boy whom he
had driven from his own camp should have thus turned the tables on him angered
him almost beyond his control. Darwood was so angry that he failed to see any
humor in the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Mr. Darwood, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; cried the Professor with
face aglow, striding forward with outstretched hand. As in Butler&#8217;s case,
Darwood professed not to see the proffered hand. He looked the Professor
squarely in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down and have a snack with us?&#8221; asked
Professor Zepplin. &#8220;We were eating when Tad fired that shot. That was very
careless of you, young man. You might have killed someone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon he knew whom he was shooting at,&#8221; answered the gold
digger. &#8220;You see, this isn&#8217;t the first time that young fellow and
myself have met.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>&#8220;Of course
not. We all met on the &#8216;Corsair,&#8217;&#8221; spoke up Rector.</p>

<p>&#8220;He and I have met since then,&#8221; answered Darwood. &#8220;I reckon
you know all about it. He came spying on our camp this morning just after
daylight, and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that isn&#8217;t true,&#8221; interjected Tad. &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you tell it straight if you are bound to tell it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The miner let one hand fall to his holster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up in this country they don&#8217;t call men liars,&#8221; answered
Darwood, looking Butler coldly in the eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then men shouldn&#8217;t place themselves in a position to be called
liars,&#8221; retorted Tad boldly. &#8220;You had better take your hand from
your revolver. If you will take the time to glance at the rock to your right you
may possibly see something to interest you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The miner cast a quick glance of inquiry in the direction indicated, and
found himself looking into the muzzle of a rifle, laid over the top of the rock.
Behind the rifle was Chunky, one eye peering over the sights.</p>

<p>Tad laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stacy!&#8221; thundered the Professor. &#8220;What does this
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, Professor,&#8221; answered Tad. &#8220;Chunky got a little
excited, that is all. You <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_188'></a>188</span>may put the gun down, Stacy. Mr. Darwood
doesn&#8217;t understand; that&#8217;s all. Sit down and have a snack with us,
as the Professor has asked you to do,&#8221; urged Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to eat with you. You know it. Don&#8217;t you go to
getting me riled or I won&#8217;t answer for the consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither will I,&#8221; answered Tad smilingly. &#8220;We are easy to
get along with unless someone treads on our toes; then it&#8217;s a different
story. Sit down and we will talk this matter over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad threw himself down beside the fire. Stacy still sat behind the rock,
gazing suspiciously at their early morning visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I demand to know the meaning of this scene,&#8221; said the Professor
sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let Mr. Darwood tell you,&#8221; replied Butler.</p>

<p>The gold digger made no answer. Tad turned to the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you what there is to it, sir. Mr. Darwood thinks we are
like some others he has met. He thinks we are trying to steal his gold
mine,&#8221; declared Tad in an impressive voice.</p>

<p>Professor Zepplin flushed deeply.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE PROFESSOR IN A RAGE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; fairly exploded Professor Zepplin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Darwood accuses us of having followed him to find out where this
wonderful gold deposit is located. He thinks we want to steal it away from
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Preposterous!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me some gold,&#8221; urged Stacy, edging near. &#8220;I am
looking for gold. I don&#8217;t make any bones about saying so,
either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be silent,&#8221; commanded the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I smelled smoke when I was out this morning,&#8221; continued Butler.
&#8220;I followed the scent until I stumbled into Mr. Darwood&#8217;s camp. It
was his signal smokes that we saw yesterday. Mr. Darwood did not give me a very
cordial welcome; he ordered me out of his camp. Not only that, but he threatened
me in case we persisted in following him. I think he would have used his pistol
on me if I had not gone away when I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this true, Darwood?&#8221; questioned the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>Professor, who was restraining himself
with an effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon it&#8217;s right, so far as it goes. I know what you fellows
are up to. You may think you can fool me, but I&#8217;ve been in these parts too
long to be an easy mark. It&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s business whether we are in
search of gold or whether we are up here for our health. Whatever our business
is, we don&#8217;t propose to have a lot of folks sticking their noses into
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you propose that we shall do?&#8221; asked Professor
Zepplin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you do,&#8221; roared the gold digger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there is nothing more to be said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes there is. There&#8217;s a lot to be said. I am not going to
say it all right here, but I reckon I&#8217;ll say it in a different way later
on. You are following us. Don&#8217;t deny it. I know you are. You pumped the
Captain and everybody else on the boat about us. Then, when you thought you had
got all the information you wanted, you followed us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not true. You know it&#8217;s a lie!&#8221; shouted the
Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful how you nag me on,&#8221; warned the miner.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know you think nothing of the kind. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>What is it that you reckon to say at
some other time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; answered Darwood, tapping his holster significantly.</p>

<p>Tad laughed softly to himself. This angered the gold digger more than
ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;You folks get out of these hills! Go anywhere you want to, but get out
and get out quick. Some more of my men are coming along to-day. If you are here
to-night it will be the worse for you,&#8221; threatened the miner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which direction would you suggest our taking?&#8221; asked Tad in a
soothing voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back the way you came. I don&#8217;t care where you go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not consistent,&#8221; laughed the freckle-faced boy.
&#8220;You tell us you don&#8217;t care where we go, then you order us to
proceed in a definite direction. You are going too far, Mr. Darwood. When you
have had a chance to cool down I think you will look at this matter in a
different light. If you will use your head a little you will see it is not
possible that we could have had any previous knowledge of your plans or of your
gold mine. You had better make friends with us. We might be of some use to you.
Professor Zepplin is a scientist. He could give you valuable help. Shall we call
quits and shake hands? Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>The words that
he would utter seemed to stick in the gold digger&#8217;s throat. He clutched
twice at his holster, but the evident desire on his part to use his pistol
appeared to have no effect at all on the Pony Rider outfit. Darwood knew very
well that drawing his weapon would practically be the end of himself, and this
did not tend to make his situation any better.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not shake hands with you. I am going back to my camp. If
you thieves are here by to-night I promise you there will be something doing.
I&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Professor Zepplin strode forward, his whiskers bristling, his fists clenched.
The boys never had seen their guardian so angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;That for your threats!&#8221; he roared, shaking a fist under the nose
of Curtis Darwood. &#8220;Your threats don&#8217;t frighten us. Your pistol
doesn&#8217;t frighten us. We&#8217;re not that kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The miner started to reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you open your mouth or I shall forget myself and slap your
face. Thieves!&#8221; Professor Zepplin struggled to master his emotions.
&#8220;Thieves! This is too much. You tell us that if we are here to-night you
will make matters lively for us. If it will accommodate you any we will remain
right here. But we should be on our way. We are going to follow <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>a straight course as near
as possible to the northwest. We shall, with reasonable luck, be about twenty
miles from here by eleven o&#8217;clock to-night. If that is the direction you
are going you will have no difficulty in finding us. But let me warn you, sir,
we shall put up with no trifling. We have as good a right to be here as have
you, and I am not sure but that we have a better right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that,&#8221; retorted Darwood angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You let us alone! Do you hear? You let us alone! If you are looking
for trouble you may have all you want and then some more besides. We are
peaceable travelers, but we know from long experience how to take care of
ourselves. Have you anything more to say to me?&#8221; demanded the
Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon not. I&#8217;ve said my say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then get out before I forget myself and hit you on the nose!&#8221;
roared Professor Zepplin. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare come fooling around our
camp again, and thank your lucky stars that Master Tad didn&#8217;t make a
mistake and shoot lower. Are you going, or are you waiting for me to throw you
out?&#8221; fumed the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;m going. You&#8217;ll hear from me again. Next time
the shoe will pinch the other foot.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>&#8220;It will
be the foot that kicks you out of camp in that case,&#8221; answered the
Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; howled the fat boy. &#8220;Three cheers for Professor
Zip-zip!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be silent!&#8221; thundered Professor Zepplin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you had better look out or he will take it out of you after Mr.
Darwood has gone,&#8221; warned Tad. &#8220;The Professor is all stirred
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Professor was. Darwood turned and strode from the camp without trusting
himself to utter another word. Professor Zepplin strode back and forth with
clenched fists, muttering to himself for five minutes after the departure of
their guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;He called us thieves!&#8221; he exclaimed, halting and glaring angrily
at Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t blame me for it,&#8221; answered the fat boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Professor, calm yourself,&#8221; begged Tad. &#8220;Those men have met
with a lot of crookedness. You can&#8217;t blame them. I shouldn&#8217;t be
surprised if some other person had been trying to follow them since they have
been out this time. They probably think we are in league with the others to get
ahead of them in the discovery of this treasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe there is any treasure,&#8221; raged the
Professor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>&#8220;As to
that, of course, I can&#8217;t say, but I should think it quite probable that
they had something definite. There must be something in what they have to go on.
They are not fools, but intelligent men. What is more, they must think they are
on the right track or they wouldn&#8217;t fly off the handle as Darwood has done
to-day. What will you do?&#8221; asked Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do? Do? What do you think I am going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Knowing you as I do, I should say you would go on as we have
planned,&#8221; answered Butler laughingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly! If that man thinks he can frighten us out of our course he
will find that he has made a grave mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you punch him when you had the chance?&#8221;
demanded Chunky. &#8220;You could have hit him an awful wallop when his chin was
in the air that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stacy! You are a savage!&#8221; rebuked the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe, maybe,&#8221; reflected the fat boy. &#8220;But judging from
some things that have occurred in this camp this morning, I&#8217;m not the only
savage in the outfit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one for you, Professor,&#8221; chuckled Ned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>&#8220;Anvik! We
break camp at once,&#8221; fairly snapped the Professor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gold man him heap fool,&#8221; grunted the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not that, Anvik. He is gold-mad like all the rest of them,&#8221;
corrected Butler. &#8220;I hope I never shall get that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be such bad fun to be gold-mad,&#8221; argued Stacy,
who usually wanted the other side of an argument. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to try
it once, if I could find enough gold to make it interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Camp was hastily broken that morning, for there was much lost time to be made
up. Everyone was eager to get started, anxious to find out what would be the
outcome of the dispute with the gold diggers.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know in what direction they&#8217;re going to move,
while they do know our route,&#8221; said Tad. &#8220;So it will be an easy
matter for Darwood to watch us as long as he wants to keep us in
sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>At seven o&#8217;clock that morning Professor Zepplin gave the word to
&#8220;mush.&#8221; This morning the Professor was extremely silent, but there
was a grim look to the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>Exciting experiences lay before them all. The boys felt it in the very air
about them. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>The
certainty made them feel buoyant and exhilarated. Surely this wild old Alaska
was a great bit of country!</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care how soon somebody starts something,&#8221; mused
Ned. &#8220;We have our heavy artillery well on ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he gazed smilingly at the tight-jawed Professor, who never looked
to better advantage than when in warlike mood.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>TAD DISCOVERS SOMETHING</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see our friends,&#8221; said Ned, an hour later.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not in their camp,&#8221; answered Tad. &#8220;We passed
that an hour ago. They have no horses, so they&#8217;re packing their outfits on
their backs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! That&#8217;s one part of the gold-madness that I don&#8217;t
want,&#8221; said Chunky. &#8220;Do all gold diggers have to pack their
outfits?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess few of them can afford to buy ponies,&#8221; answered Butler.
&#8220;Then, too, the places they go to are usually beyond the reach of anything
except a wild animal. We are fortunate if we get through with our stock. Even
our own ponies that we left at home would never be able to make this rough
trail. What&#8217;s that, Anvik?&#8221;</p>

<p>The guide was pointing to a waving ribbon of white that appeared to reach
from point to point on the rocks high above them and some distance ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; demanded the boy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>&#8220;Him
goat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mountain goats? Look, boys!&#8221; cried Tad.</p>

<p>Stacy threw up his rifle and took a shot. Of course he missed. A leaping
mountain goat is not an easy mark even for the best shot, and the fat boy, while
shooting very well, could hardly be called an expert.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are the animals from which the beautiful blankets are
made,&#8221; the Professor informed them. &#8220;Do you know how the Indians get
the wool?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They pull it out by the roots, I guess,&#8221; suggested Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; laughed Ned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spring is the shedding time. The goats, in leaping from place to
place, leave tufts of wool clinging to rocks and bushes, and this the lazy
Indians gather for their blankets, rather than take the trouble to hunt the
goats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Squaw him get wool,&#8221; spoke up Anvik.</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse yet,&#8221; laughed Butler. &#8220;You are the laziest folks on
earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Squaw work, him no talk lies. Him mouth keep shut.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys laughed at this crude reasoning of the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did they teach you at the Mission to make your squaws work?&#8221;
asked Tad Butler.</p>

<p>Anvik shook his head slowly. He did not answer <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>in words, but hastened his pony&#8217;s
pace by his heavy pull at the halter.</p>

<p>All that day the boys kept a lookout for smoke, but in vain. After they had
made camp that night the Professor said:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are indications here of unusual formations. If you have no
objections I should like to remain here for a day, perhaps two, and do research
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, Professor,&#8221; replied Tad. &#8220;The ponies will be better
for a rest, and maybe we can do some hunting. How about it, Anvik?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anvik not care,&#8221; was the guide&#8217;s reply.</p>

<p>After breakfast the next morning the Professor set off at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, fellows,&#8221; said Tad, &#8220;I propose that Stacy and I
follow that ravine to the left and Ned and Walter go to the right. From the
formation I should say that some time late in the day we ought to meet.
It&#8217;s wild in those passes, and we should get game.&#8221;</p>

<p>After arranging that three quick shots should announce the finding of game
and that the distress signal of one shot, a pause, then two quick shots should
be a call for help, the boys set off, each carrying biscuit, a drinking cup, and
matches, besides their rifles.</p>

<p>The boys tramped all morning without sighting game.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>After a short
rest the two boys went on again, bearing more to the left. As they trudged on
the sound of rushing water was borne to their ears. Then they came out on a
broad stream, a torrent that came from the top of three lofty, ice-covered
mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s work up toward that pass,&#8221; suggested Tad, wishing to
see the gulch from which the stream was flowing.</p>

<p>They had worked their way upstream for half a mile when Chunky yelled:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there! What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad saw a hideous head projecting above the bushes. At first he was startled,
then he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a totem pole, Chunky. They&#8217;re put up usually in
behalf of the Indian dead to drive the spirits away. Let&#8217;s go and look at
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The totem pole was standing at the entrance of a second narrow gulch. Sand
and shale rock were heaped up at the entrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;A stream flowed through here at one time, Stacy. I imagine that it was
the same body of water we&#8217;ve just been looking at.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeh,&#8221; said Stacy absently. &#8220;Say, Tad, let&#8217;s see who
can first hit that evil-looking thing with a stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tad laughed and stooped to pick up a stone. As he did so, he noticed an arrow
cut into the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>rock
at one side of the gulch, the point of the arrow aimed up the gulch.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s queer,&#8221; muttered the boy. &#8220;I suppose
it&#8217;s an Indian sign. This is a place of many mysteries.&#8221; He stooped
to pick up the rusty-looking stone that had caught his glance. It was worn full
of holes as if by the action of water and when he took it in his hand its
heaviness aroused his curiosity. Opening his knife, he dug into the stone.</p>

<p>Tad&#8217;s face flushed a vivid red, and he uttered a sharp exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; demanded Stacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much. Maybe I&#8217;ve made a discovery. Don&#8217;t
let&#8217;s idle here. Let&#8217;s go on and see if we can&#8217;t get our bear.
This seems to be our lucky day,&#8221; said the boy, pocketing the stone and
once more shouldering his rifle. &#8220;Come, mush, as Anvik would
say.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p>Professor Zepplin had been closeted in his tent for an hour when he beckoned
Tad Butler to enter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boy, this rusty stone that you picked up is a gold nugget, worth, I
should say, all of five hundred dollars!&#8221; cried the Professor excitedly.
&#8220;Are there more of them, Tad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say. I found this one on a bar where it was probably
washed down. The place was once a stream, but it changed its course and is now
some distance to the west. I&#8217;ve an idea that there&#8217;s gold in that
sand-bar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;d better go after it. It probably belongs to no
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure of that. Others may have a juster claim than we
have, Professor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You suspect something, Tad, without knowing fully. We&#8217;ll look at
the place and decide what to do later.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others were in bed, but still awake when Tad left the Professor&#8217;s
tent, but to their questions he gave evasive answers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>It seemed to Tad
that he had been asleep but a few minutes when he felt a touch on his shoulder.
He sat up, instantly wide awake. Anvik was bending over him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody come,&#8221; muttered the guide. &#8220;One, two, three,
four, maybe more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Day was just breaking. Tad awakened his companions, giving each instructions
as to what he was to do. Then he hurried to the Professor&#8217;s tent to give
Anvik&#8217;s news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out!&#8221; yelled Stacy shrilly.</p>

<p>A series of quick, sharp reports punctured the stillness of the morning. Tad
and Professor Zepplin dashed out, and so did Walter Perkins. Ned Rector and
Stacy Brown were nowhere to be seen. Anvik stood against a rock, his blanket
drawn about him, the muzzle of a rifle protruding from the lower end of it.</p>

<p>Four men appeared in the open, each holding a rifle. The rifles were aimed at
the members of the Pony Rider outfit.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Darwood!&#8221; gasped the Professor. It was Darwood,
accompanied by Sam Dawson, Dill Bruce and Curley Tinker. &#8220;What&#8217;s the
meaning of this outrage, gentlemen?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I gave you warning to mush back to where you came from,&#8221;
answered Darwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I told you we&#8217;d do nothing of the sort!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_205'></a>205</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re going now, and in a
hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you do if we refuse again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find out what we&#8217;ll do. We&#8217;re north of
fifty-three now. You know what that means. Put down those guns, and do it
quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you set the example,&#8221; said Tad quietly. He had not
spoken up to this point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep still!&#8221; commanded Darwood. &#8220;Put down those
guns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be in a hurry,&#8221; advised Tad. &#8220;Before you do
anything that you&#8217;ll regret, let me say that every man of you is covered.
The slightest hostile motion on your part is your death warrant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Indian&#8217;s got away!&#8221; cried Dawson.</p>

<p>Darwood for the first time realized that all the Pony Rider outfit was not in
sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Either your friends will put down their guns and come out or
we&#8217;ll shoot,&#8221; snarled Darwood, fixing his gaze on Tad Butler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you so anxious to die, Curtis Darwood?&#8221; asked the lad
calmly.</p>

<p>Darwood flushed, but the four men lowered their rifles to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Darwood, I have something to tell you. Sit down,&#8221; went on
the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ll do nothing of the sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, I say!&#8221;</p>

<p>The men obeyed reluctantly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>&#8220;Keep them
covered until they come to their senses, boys,&#8221; directed Tad. Then he went
on to the men: &#8220;We don&#8217;t blame you for feeling that every
man&#8217;s hand is against you; but I&#8217;m going to prove to you that ours
are not. See this?&#8221; and Tad tossed to Darwood the rusty stone that he had
found in the sand-bar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gold! A nugget of pure gold,&#8221; breathed Darwood. &#8220;Where did
you get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we found the Taku Pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ve lost it,&#8221; groaned Dawson.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll fight for it, then!&#8221; shouted Darwood.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might wait until there&#8217;s need for fighting, Mr.
Darwood,&#8221; said Tad contemptuously. He then went on to describe the totem
pole, while his listeners became more and more excited. They got out an old map,
and after studying it Tad said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the Taku Pass that Stacy and I discovered. As it is undoubtedly
yours, we relinquish all claim to the land.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much do you want for the relinquishment?&#8221; asked Dawson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing. Sit down and have breakfast with us and then we will lead you
to the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say much,&#8221; said Darwood falteringly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve been a bunch of driveling idiots.&#8221;</p>

<p>After breakfast Anvik was sent to the men&#8217;s <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>camp for pans and implements and
supplies, and the others set off in Tad Butler&#8217;s wake to explore the
gulch.</p>

<p>At one point the party found a slender vein of pure gold, enough to give hope
that the vein broadened out farther on. Tad, in a cavelike niche, saw a gray
streak of ore that reached for a long distance. A piece of this about the size
of a goose egg lay at his feet. It was heavy, and he put it in his pocket to
show to the others.</p>

<p>Anvik came in with the tools, surveying chains, and pans, and Darwood and the
others staked off their claims, taking in enough to give each boy a claim,
putting up heaps of stones to mark the boundaries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, if anyone else were to file a prior claim we&#8217;d have a
hard time to substantiate ours. But there&#8217;s not much danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>The claim staked, Darwood proposed that they pan in the bar to see what they
could find. To the delight of all, sparkling particles of rich yellow dust lay
in the bottoms of the sieves, and they felt convinced that there was gold in
paying quantities.</p>

<p>Once more back in the camp, the Professor disappeared into his tent. When he
emerged he looked excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Boys!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Tad! Your sample <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>is platinum! Gentlemen, you have indeed
a fortune! The platinum is worth about double its weight in gold!&#8221;</p>

<p>Such a hurrah as went up! Such an evening of rejoicing and excitement! But
early the next morning came the reaction.</p>

<p>Tad, up early, went out to the claim, too impatient to await breakfast. To
his amazement instead of finding the markers they had set, he found that they
had been removed, and in their places some one had cut off saplings and marked
the stumps of them with deep-cut notches.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that rascal, Sandy Ketcham,&#8221; declared Darwood in a
strained voice, when Tad reported his discovery. &#8220;He&#8217;s been on our
trail for nearly three years, and now he&#8217;s got us! He&#8217;s on his way
to Skagway now to register the claim in the land office,&#8221; the man
groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get ahead of them, then,&#8221; cried Tad. &#8220;He
hasn&#8217;t much of a start. When does a steamer leave Yakutat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the twenty-third. The &#8216;Corsair&#8217; will leave Yakutat on
the twenty-seventh. He will just about make it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So will I,&#8221; cried Tad Butler stoutly.</p>

<p>Tad won Professor Zepplin&#8217;s consent to his plan, and after Darwood had
got the papers ready and the boys had gathered provisions together, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>Tad was off, riding one
pony and leading another, that he might change from one to the other, thus
avoiding tiring either.</p>

<p>With lather standing out all over his mount, Tad pounded on, eyes and ears
alight for Sandy Ketcham. He halted at noon to change horses and let each drink
a little from a spring. Then on once more for seemingly countless hours.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause in the evening, to allow the ponies to rest and
graze, then on again in the darkness. The second night a longer rest was
imperative, while Tad fretted, tired as he was, to be off again.</p>

<p>On the third day he came across the still hot ashes of a campfire, and
decided that he was not far behind Ketcham. Still twenty miles from Yakutat, one
of the ponies strained a tendon. The boy was forced regretfully to abandon the
animal and to go forward on the second mount.</p>

<p>It was about eleven o&#8217;clock in the morning of the fourth day that he
caught sight of a column of black smoke through an opening between the
mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the &#8216;Corsair,&#8217;&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;She&#8217;s
getting ready to sail.&#8221;</p>

<p>On and on he rode. He swept through the village on the panting pony and down
to the dock to see the &#8216;Corsair&#8217; weighing anchor.</p>

<p>Tad Butler set up a yell, then drove his pony <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>into the bay. No small boats were in
sight, so, throwing himself in the icy water, he grasped the pony&#8217;s mane
and, swimming with the animal, headed for the ship.</p>

<p>The anchor was up, but Captain Petersen had not yet signaled for slow speed
ahead. He ordered a boat lowered and Tad was hauled aboard in a semi-dazed
condition. Relieved of its burden, the pony rose and swam for shore. Tad was
confined to his cabin, worn out by the hard ride and the icy swim. But he
learned that Ketcham was on board, and Ketcham, of course, knew of Tad&#8217;s
presence.</p>

<p>The morning of their arrival at Skagway was gray and windy. The sea was
rolling into the harbor in heavy, boisterous swells. The captain announced that
he would not put off a boat until the sea subsided, as capsizing was certain in
the heavy seas.</p>

<p>Tad, impatient, was standing at the rail when he saw Sandy Ketcham leap over
the rail into the sea. The boy did not hesitate. He sprang to the rail and dived
as far out as he could, striking a rod or so behind Ketcham. Then began a
desperate race. But youth won, and Tad staggered out of the water a few moments
ahead of his adversary and ran for the land office, Ketcham close behind
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I file the claim to Taku Pass in the name of <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>Curtis Darwood and others,&#8221;
shouted Tad, slapping the oilskin parcel on the desk. &#8220;That man&#8217;s an
impostor. He destroyed our markers and erected his own on our claim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie!&#8221; yelled Sandy, making a leap for the boy.</p>

<p>There was a furious fight, in which the interested bystanders did not
interfere. But at last Tad&#8217;s fist shot up in a vicious uppercut on the
man&#8217;s chin, and Sandy Ketcham settled to the floor as the boy leaped out
of the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you filed the papers?&#8221; gasped Tad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure, boy! You&#8217;ve won the first round. The rest will be up to
the government, but I guess you&#8217;ve got it clinched for all
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Tad returned to Yakutat three government surveyors went with him to run
the lines and definitely establish the claim. Sandy Ketcham also filed a claim,
but Tad&#8217;s being the prior one the case would have to be decided by the
proper government officials; though there was really no doubt of the
outcome.</p>

<p>For a month after Tad Butler&#8217;s return the Pony Rider Boys stayed at
Taku Pass, panning over a section allotted to them by the Gold Diggers, each
filling a small sack with yellow dust and a few nuggets. In addition the Gold
Diggers insisted that the boys and their tutor jointly should have a twentieth
interest in the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_212'></a>212</span>claims, which would undoubtedly give each a
comfortable amount of wealth.</p>

<p>It was their last night in the camp and the boys and the Professor were
talking over future plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going home to rest and study after my strenuous life of the
last few seasons,&#8221; the Professor stated. &#8220;How about you,
Walter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father has a job for me as messenger in a bank in St. Joseph,&#8221;
answered Walter Perkins.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your turn, Chunky. What&#8217;s it to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Banking. I&#8217;m going into Walter Perkins&#8217; father&#8217;s
bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does father know about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he does!&#8221; retorted Stacy. &#8220;Did you think I was
going to break into the bank?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t tell about you,&#8221; laughed Tad. &#8220;As for Ned and
me&#8211;Professor Zepplin&#8217;s friend, Colonel Van Zandt, who has large
timber interests, has used his influence to get us appointments in the United
States Forestry Service. We&#8217;ll go to work next spring. And now, fellows, I
suggest that we give three cheers for the best fellow that ever lived, Professor
Zepplin!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cheers were given with a will, then all went to their tents for their
last night in their camp in Alaska.</p>

<p class='tp' style='margin-top:2em;'>THE END</p>
